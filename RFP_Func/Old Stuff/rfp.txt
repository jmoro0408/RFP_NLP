RE:   Statement of Qualifications: Hillsborough County Aviation Authority, Program Management Consultant at  
  Tampa International Airport (TPA), Tampa, Florida (Solicitation No. 13-411-021)
Dear Selection Committee:
Jacobs, in collaboration with our principal sub- consultants, AECOM and PGAL, has assembled the elite in the aviation 
industry to augment your staff as specifically outlined in the above-referenced solicitation. Our long term presence and 
experience at TPA as well as in the Tampa Bay region, gives our team the understanding of your airport operations and busi-
ness practices that will provide immediate dividends to the Authority. This experience, amplified with worldwide expertise in 
aviation program management, will provide you the best assistance in the industry to ensure your vision as a vibrant aviation 
gateway for Tampa Bay continues to be a reality.  Outstanding customer service is a goal we share with the Authority.  To 
that end, our team has worked together previously and will provide the highest caliber personnel with the right technical 
capabilities at the right time, to successfully supplement your staff and maximize your capital investments. 
Jacobs as well as AECOM have had a major corporate presence in Tampa for 30+ years, and have a combined total of more 
than 460 employees engaged in a multitude of business, community, and philanthropic endeavors throughout the Region. 
TPA is our primary airport; our firms generate an estimated 1,500 enplanements per year as part of the economic impact of 
our combined corporate presence in the area. We have a strong, vested interest in the viability and success of this program. 
Our proposed Key Personnel are: Todd McClendon, Project Manager (Jacobs); Peter Elgohary, Project Controls Manager 
(Jacobs); Jeffrey Weiner, AIA, Design Quality Assurance Manager (PGAL); and John Cordner, PE, Construction Quality 
Assurance Manager (AECOM). With more than 100 years of combined airport experience, including a number of years  
working together at ATL, they will augment your staff and deliver the following benefits:
Augmenting and Enhancing Authority staff by:
»  Providing four senior-level, industry-recognized airport experts in management support, design and construction 
quality management and oversight, and practical project controls processes.
»  Using our team’s past knowledge and experience to bring lessons learned and industry best practices from similar 
airport programs, from commencement to completion.
»  Maintaining focus and bringing best practices to uphold the highest level of safety during the program. This will 
prevent impacts to airport operations and protect the experience of the travelling and general public, airport 
workers, contractors, and vendors.
Delivering Efficiency through Responsive Scalability by: 
»  Providing access to additional depth and support (when needed), of airport professionals both locally and globally 
through Jacobs, AECOM, PGAL, and our local subcontractor firms’ extensive bench of resources.

»  Strategically leveraging and cost-effectively using additional general and technical support staff that are currently 
supporting other airport programs throughout the nation for tactical project assistance when you need it.
Optimizing Design and Construction Delivery Processes through:
»  Application of our collective knowledge, expertise, and colloborative, work approach while integrated with the 
Authority staff to meet Master Plan objectives throughout the program.
»  Utilizing our knowledge of the design/build delivery contracting method, total cost of ownership framework, and 
experience working in Tampa Bay and greater state of Florida to boost cost control practices on the program and 
maximize cost efficiency.
»  Supporting the integrated project delivery team with effective, efficient processes for management and integration 
of information for all project team members, key stakeholders, and tenants.
»  Leveraging AECOM and PGAL’s national prominence in planning, design, construction, and activation of ConRACs to 
these portions of the program.
Maximizing TPA’s Return-on-Investment by:
»  Minimizing the learning curve of team onboarding by employing AECOM and our Woman and Minority Owned 
Business Enterprise (W/MBE) firms who have a long history of delivering projects at TPA, as our onboarding and 
‘client experts’ to provide support for administrative matters (i.e. badging and security clearances, logistics, and 
overview of reporting structures).
»  Adding value by application of lessons learned from similar programs, most recently from Hartsfield-Jackson 
Atlanta International Airport (ATL) capital program with the internal team, Authority staff, design/builder, and other 
key program stakeholders. 
»  Boosting the existing relationships with TPA contractors (i.e. Austin Commercial, Skanska, Demattei Wong, HOK, 
Jacobsen-Daniels, Paslay Associates) to develop an especially collaborative approach starting on day one.
With our Key Personnel and collective expertise and resources of AECOM and PGAL we are committed to working together 
with you to deliver a world-class program and continue to maximize the economic growth and vitality of the Tampa Bay 
region. We look forward to further discussions and interaction with the Selection Committee as part of the evaluation 
process. Please do not hesitate to contact me should you have any questions.
Sincerely,
Jacobs

Brief Assignment Description: 
The Terminal B Renovation Program replaced the concourse/gate area of the south side of 
Terminal B at IAH, replacing the 19 southern gates with 30 new gates optimized for regional

United Airlines and the ramp improvements and infrastructure upgrades managed by the City of 
Houston. 
Project Assignment / Role:  Project Manager / The Terminal B Renovation Program was 
shelved in 2008 due to economic conditions unfavorable for the terminal renovation/expansion.

responsible for assembling the A/E team to refresh the old Terminal B design to meet new 
operational criteria and updated code requirements. Once design was completed, Peter issued the 
RFQ for construction, evaluated the bidders, and selected the winning bidder to perform the

Detailed Assignment Participation and Responsibilities: 
 
The Terminal B Renovation Program replaced the concourse/gate area of the south side of 
Terminal B at IAH, replacing the 19 southern gates with 30 new gates optimized for regional 
aircraft (50-70 seaters). The $150MM scope is a combination of the terminal work managed by 
United Airlines and the ramp improvements and infrastructure upgrades managed by the City of 
Houston. 
 
The $150M Terminal B Renovation Program was shelved in 2008 due to economic conditions 
unfavorable for the terminal renovation/expansion. In 2010, the project was restarted and Peter 
Elgohary served as the Project Manager. He was responsible for assembling the A/E team to 
refresh the old Terminal B design to meet new operational criteria and updated code 
requirements. Once design was completed, Peter issued the RFQ for construction, evaluated the 
bidders, and selected the winning bidder to perform the required work. Once the team was 
mobilized and demo was underway, Peter passed the project on to another project manager for  
oversight of the day-to-day activities.

Brief Assignment Description: 
PGAL led a joint venture that managed the programming, planning and design of the new Rental 
Agency Complex, or ConRAC, at ATL. This project, the largest consolidated rental car facility 
in operation today, is located on a 67-acre site near the airport and is accessed by a 1.5-mile 
above-ground people mover, or APM, and an access road that crosses a major interstate, local 
highway and a railroad. Program elements include two four-level garage structures totaling 2.8M 
SF and 8,700 ready/return/storage spaces, a 140,000 SF customer terminal that accommodates 12 
rental car agencies, and seven maintenance and storage areas, commonly known as QTA’s, or 
Quick Turnaround Areas, that contain fueling, wash and maintenance facilities with 140 fuel 
dispensers, 32 wash bays, and 16 light maintenance bays. Additional work elements include on-
site roadways to support the facilities vehicular infrastructure and an extensive signage and 
graphics package. The APM is the third stop on a system that connects the rental car center with 
the central terminal area and the new Georgia International Convention Center, a true testament 
to the public-private partnership between two neighboring cities and developers. PGAL was also 
responsible for the design and oversight of rental car build-out for exclusive use areas. This 
facility is seeking LEED certification.

KEY PERSONNEL RESUMES 
 
Name of Respondent Submitting RFQ:  Jacobs Project Management Co. 
 
Person’s Name:        Jeffrey A. Weiner, AIA 
 
Detailed Assignment Participation and Responsibilities: 
Jeff Weiner’s role for PGAL on this project was principal manager participating full-time from 
beginning to end over a six year duration.  Jeff relocated to Atlanta and established PGAL’s 
seventh regional office, employing 15 local Atlanta design professionals. Today, that office 
remains in operation and serves as PGAL’s rental car planning studio home as well as their 
southeastern (outside of Florida) base. 
 
Jeff led the development of the overall project scope and fee for the Joint Venture Design Team, 
inclusive of all project phases, components and deliverables. He was responsible for the 
development of the project program, refining the planning document that had been developed 
over the previous decade, and quickly helped align the project program, goals and budget.  
Working closely with the City, the designated Program Management Team and the RAC 
Industry, the Design Team, all managed by Jeff, created and issued a Program Design Manual 
(PDM), that established the overall program (ConRAC facility and a connecting APM system to 
the Terminal), budget and schedule that was used for building consensus among the numerous 
stakeholders and created financial models for funding.   
 
Jeff was responsible for preparing and presenting the project at various stages to the City, the 
Airport’s Executive Committee, the RAC Industry and the project stakeholders.  He was able to 
build upon his previous experience with large consolidated rental car facilities at Dallas/ Fort 
Worth and Houston Intercontinental Airport’s as he directed the operational planning and 
modeling for the largest consolidated rental car facility in operation today.  That operational 
planning created a high-volume, vertical circulation solution that moves customers quickly and 
efficiently through its four-level Customer Service Center and into its pair of four-level parking 
structures split by the APM system. It also created a well-organized one-way loop road to 
facilitate a high-volume of traffic and was also instrumental in defining a high-level of customer 
services and equality among the participating rental car companies.       
 
Jeff was responsible for the design efforts of more than 20 project consultants, coordination with 
the Airport’s PM Team, the APM Design-Build Team and the Construction Manager.  Jeff also 
led the Design Team in the overall Quality Assurance / Quality Control efforts, as well as the 
value engineering effort with the Construction Manager to buyout the project without a 
minimization of program, a difficult task with the then escalating costs of labor and materials 
putting pressure on budgets and financing.  Jeff remains in close contact today with Airport staff 
and the facility’s manager to understand the post-occupancy operational issues and to bring 
lessons learned from the ATL ConRAC to future consolidated rental car projects.

Brief Assignment Description: 
PGAL led a collaborative team effort charged with the performance of a Concept Design and 
Environmental Permit study that led to the programming, planning and development of this 
unique ConRAC at one of the most land constrained airports in the nation. Constructed over 
multiple phases, this facility will replace the existing rental car operations essentially in-place, as 
the new facility will be built “on-top-of” the existing rental car sites within the Southwest 
Service Area. The 49-acre site is the center for ground transportation operations at the Airport. 
The environmentally friendly phased redevelopment includes a 4-level parking structure for 
3,200 ready/return/storage spaces, a 120,000 SF customer terminal, and four limited maintenance 
service areas for vehicular fleets. Additional elements of the program include multiple roadway 
modifications to improve roadway and reduce terminal curb congestion, a bus access ramp that 
supports the two-level customer terminal and a unified common busing system for all of BOS, 
and improved facilities for the Airport’s taxi, bus and limousine pools. In addition to a complex 
building program, this development consists of an extensive environmental mitigation measures 
for greenhouse gases, energy consumption and water quality/ usage. Stakeholder benefits allow 
the project to buffer the adjacent neighborhoods from ground transportation operations and 
create a definition of airport boundaries within the residential community. This project is 
pursuing LEED Gold Certification.

Detailed Assignment Participation and Responsibilities: 
Jeff Weiner’s role for PGAL on this project was again all inclusive, participating full-time from 
beginning to what will be the end of the project in 2014, an eight year duration. This project 
allowed the establishment of PGAL’s ninth regional office in Downtown Boston, currently 
employing five local design professionals.  This office supports the PGAL rental car planning 
studio as well as projects throughout the northeast. 
 
Jeff and PGAL were initially responsible for the development of a multiple phase Environmental 
Impact report and Concept Design Study which led to the approval for this significant project at 
Boston Logan International Airport.  This multi-phase and multi-year effort allowed Massport to 
finalize their long awaiting redevelopment plan for the Southwest Service Area, home for all 
ground transportation functions, and obtain a consensus of planning, phasing, design, schedule 
and budget from the RAC Industry.  Jeff led this effort and coordinated a large, multi-discipline 
team of local consultants, along with the various stakeholder departments within Massport, 
including Environmental Planning & Design, Finance, Airport Business Office, Capital 
Programs, Community Outreach and Ground Transportation.  Key deliverables during the phase 
included the development of the project program, its rightsizing of elements to align with the 
budget, and refinement of the planning document that allowed for project acceleration. 
 
Following the completion of the initial phase for environmental permitting and concept design, 
PGAL and PB reversed contractual roles, with Jeff (PGAL) remaining as the Buildings Design 
Manager, RAC Planner and Architect of Record (AOR) for the ConRAC, again coordinating 
multiple design consultants, leading the overall design team’s Quality Assurance/Quality Control 
efforts, and collaborating with all project stakeholders, including Massport, the CMR (Suffolk 
Construction), the RAC Industry and the neighboring community. Jeff was also responsible for 
the numerous rental car enabling projects (National/Alamo/Enterprise consolidation into one 
operational area, Hertz relocation and reconfiguration of site and Budget modifications) that 
were required for project phasing.  Again, Jeff (PGAL) served as Design Manager, RAC Planner 
and AOR for these three enabling projects.  
 
Jeff was responsible for preparing and presenting the project at various stages to Massport, the 
RAC Industry and the project stakeholders. The design of the facility at operational planning 
created a high-volume, space  that moves customers quickly and efficiently through the 
Customer Service Center and into the four-level parking structure. It also created a well-
organized one-way loop road to facilitate a high-volume of traffic was also instrumental in 
defining a high-level of customer services and equality among the participating rental car 
companies.

Other Experience and Qualities Relevant to Assignment: 
Jeff has spent the better part of his 30 years of professional practice and experience managing 
and designing parking garage and transportation related projects.  In fact, he has dedicated the 
previous 15 years working almost exclusively on on-airport rental car facilities for both airport 
authorities and RAC companies, travelling extensively and taking advantage of the opportunity 
to experience just about every rental car facility, whether consolidated or not, in the country.   
 
Jeff brings a unique understanding of this particular project type, along with an ability to work 
with and through large teams and multiple tenants, and is able to build consensus among 
competitors within the RAC Industry and the Owner / Tenant relationship -- this is Jeff's strength 
and how he adds value to a team and a client.  Jeff also understands not only the more traditional 
roles a consultant performs on a project, like Quality Assurance Management, but the non-
traditional roles of business planning issues, alternate methods of construction, schedule and 
budget compliance at all levels, and the need for collaboration and consensus building. 
 
Jeff is a member of the American Association of Airport Executives and is often called upon to 
speak at their annual Rental Car Workshop, offering his insight into the planning and design of 
consolidated rental car facilities while stressing the importance of collaboration between airports 
and the RAC Industry that is needed to achieve a successful project.

Detailed Assignment Participation and Responsibilities: 
For the ATL International Terminal Improvements, John served as Construction Manager, 
overseeing the CMAR for this $1.2B project. This complex consists of a new 16-gate 
international terminal with 12 aircraft in the maximum wide-body configuration to the east side 
of the current airport complex. The new terminal (Concourse F) will have approximately 1 
million SF of new area and will include international passenger support facilities, passenger hold 
rooms, US Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) facility expansion, ticketing/check-
in facilities for all international departing flights, passenger security screening, concessions, 
baggage handling/screening facilities, a two level curb front, airline facilities, passenger loading 
bridges, a passenger/baggage connector to the international concourse (Concourse E), an 
extension of the existing automated people mover (APM) system, and the addition/relocation of 
APM support facilities. The addition of Concourse F, with its eight Group 5 and four Group 4 
aircraft compatible gates, will increase the total number of international gates at ATL to 38. 
When completed, there will be two fully functional CBP facilities at ATL: the existing facility at 
Concourse E and the new facility at the MHJIT. Arriving international passengers who are 
terminating in Atlanta will be able to exit both facilities directly to curbside at the new Terminal. 
 
The new terminal facility, including the new aircraft apron area, will be built on an embankment 
constructed of approximately 2 million cubic yards of engineered fill material. The embankment 
project scope of work will also include retaining walls, extensive underground utility 
additions/modifications, an aircraft hydrant fueling system, a reinforcement of the Flint River 
encasement, and a Georgia Power Company electrical tunnel. To support the new terminal, a 
new parking structure with 1,366 short-term parking spaces will be constructed directly adjacent 
to it. A pedestrian bridge and an employee access path will connect the parking structure with the 
terminal, allowing direct access between facilities without any pedestrian interfaces with 
roadway traffic.

Detailed Assignment Participation and Responsibilities: 
For the LAX Bradley West Terminal Expansion, John served as Senior Construction Manager, 
overseeing the fast-track construction-manager-at-risk (CMAR).  This 1-million SF expansion 
and 500,000 SF renovation consists new 16-gate concourses that accommodates eight ADG-VI 
aircraft in addition to other wide-body aircraft, new security checkpoint, new inbound baggage 
system, expanded Customs and Border Patrol facilities, triple passenger boarding bridge 
configurations for ADG-VI aircraft, conveyances, CUTE and EVIDS, and, a seven story core 
area with an Integrated Environmental Media System with multi-story LED screens, 
concessions, airline lounges.  The logistical planning modified the original Master Plan concept 
to allow a phased opening, minimize disruption to continuing operations in the adjacent 
operating terminal, and provide environmental controls ahead of the services from the Central 
Utility plant.  The fast-track approach allowed a compressed construction schedule to meet the 
gate demand for the new large aircraft.

Other Experience and Qualities Relevant to Assignment: 
John Cordner provides 30 years of design and construction management to this program.As 
project manager and construction manager, he has managed extremely complex runway and 
terminal projects at LAX, ATL, YEG, PHL, and SAT. His current assignment is Senior Project 
Manager on the $1.5 billion expansion and renovation of the Tom Bradley International 
Terminal.  The project known as Bradley West is an iconic element of the $6 billion LAX 
Development Program to accommodate the New Large Aircraft and implement the capital 
improvements in the 2015 master plan. Prior to this, he managed construction of the $1.2 billion 
fifth runway at ATL concurrent with $390M of other airfield taxiway and runway projects.  The 
end result was an on time and under budget completion of the massive Runway 10-28 program 
for the overall $5.4B ATL improvement program.  These programs required detailed 
construction phasing, meticulous site logistics, constant communication and consensus building 
with all parties (including the program manager), and innovative construction methods. His 
leadership on terminal projects has also yielded substantial time and cost savings. John has also 
managed airport terminal and airfield projects at Edmonton, Philadelphia and San Antonio, as 
well as other architecturally significant building construction projects.

parking deck; and a 1.5 mile long, dual-lane elevated Automated People Mover (APM) 
Train System. The CM effort was executed with a blended staff of Jacobs and AECOM 
integrated with the Department of Aviation team.
The RCC is a four-story building, with the fourth-story serving as the destination APM 
Train Customer Service Center Station stop for rental agencies. It is an open, airy 
area with connecting escalators, elevators, bathrooms, multi-user flight information 
displays (MUFIDS), ticketing kiosks, and station art. It was built by the CM@R con-
tractor Austin-PRAD (a Joint Venture comprised of Austin Commercial, LP and Prad 
Group, Inc.). The second and third floors include rental agency customer service space 
totaling 540 linear feet of counter space for 13 different agencies. The four-story 
atrium receives natural daylight through a 27,500-SF North-facing glass curtain-wall. 
A daylight harvesting lighting system provides consistent illumination during daylight, 
night time and overcast weather.
The RCC is connected at both the North face and the South face to the parking decks 
via three two-story and two single-story open-air pedestrian bridges, spanning 90 feet 
each. The fourth level of the RCC is the APM station platform, more commonly referred 
to as the Customer Service Center (CSC) Station.
ATL Sky Train enhances customer 
experience and ConRAC connectivity.

OUR APPROACH TO MANAGING CONSTRUCTION:
Our approach to managing construction was to establish an environment where all 
parties shared in the success of the project. The various members each had distinct 
responsibilities which had to be blended into a comprehensive team. Our Team’s suc-
cess or failure relied on the efforts of all team members, and this focus was never lost 
during the four-year construction process. Since the project had several major compo-
nents, timely communication was essential across all the project components.
“Since the beginning of the  This was facilitated through progress meetings, issue resolution meetings, project site

The ConRAC Program was delivered using several conventional construction methods. 
– Stephen Morris, Director, The HACM Joint Venture Team, led by Jacobs, was responsible for providing Agency 
Construction Management services to the Atlanta Department of Aviation. The ConRAC 
Central Passenger Terminal 
Program was comprised of two major components: (1) mass grading, construction of 
Complex
the RCCsite, customer service center station, and rental vehicles support facilities; and 
(2) construction of the APM with associated guide-way, train stations, maintenance 
and storage facility.
»  The RCC was constructed using the Construction Manager at Risk (CM@R) delivery 
method.
RCC provides a convenient, centralized car rental location that helps minimize traffic congestion.

»  The APM was a Design-Build-Operate & Maintain (DBOM) contract. Midway 
through the project, a change order was issued on the DBOM contract which 
included the construction of two additional train stations. The stations change order 
was a traditional design/bid/build delivery method that was constructed within the 
duration of the base contract. Under the terms of the contract, the sub-contractor, 
Mitsubishi and Sumitomo, would operate and maintain the APM system facility for 
the first five years after final acceptance.
As a part of the ConRAC Program, our Team was also responsible for providing CM 
oversight as the Owner’s Representative for the projects detailed below:
APM Train System: The DBOM contractor constructed the APM Train System which 
services three stations: (1) The Customer Service Center Station; (2) The Gateway Sta-
tion; and (3) The Central Passenger Terminal Complex (CPTC) Station. The APM Train 
Systems is a 1.5 mile long, dual-lane elevated guideway that operates on a pinched-
loop system. The initial capacity of the APM was 2,700 persons/per hour/per day; the 
ultimate capacity is 5,100 persons/per hour/per day. There are 2.5 minutes of headway 
per station, totalling 10 minutes, round trip.
Gateway Station: Also constructed by the DBOM contractor, the Gateway Station is a 
9,600 SF, five-story, 85-foot-high enclosed train station that serves the Georgia Inter-
national Convention Center and is the intermediate stop between the CSC (Customer 
Service Center) station and CPTC Station. The building is supported independently 
from the guide-way by concrete columns with conditioned public areas, enclosed by 
metal panels with a sloping membrane roof. The platform level consists of glass for 
natural lighting with curved ceiling and terrazzo flooring.
Central Passenger Terminal Complex (CPTC) Station: Also constructed by the 
DBOM contractor the CPTC Station is a 19,970 SF, two-story, 50-foot-high train 
station that serves the Central Passenger Terminal Complex and Ground Transporta-
tion Center. The building is supported independently from the guide-way by concrete 
columns with conditioned public areas, enclosed by metal panels with a membrane 
roof. The platform is enclosed and served by stainless steel and glass platform station 
doors, architectural terrazzo, along with vertical conveyances and granite stairs.

Authority’s professional team.
Quick Turnaround Areas (QTAs): Seven QTAs were built to provide the rental agen-
cies with full-service facilities all in one location. The seven different QTAs are used by 
13 different rental agencies. Altogether, the QTAs provide 4,000 ground-level storage 
spaces for vehicles, 136 fuel and vacuum areas, 20 carwash bays with water recovery 
systems and 24 vehicle maintenance and service bays. There are also storage spaces 
and administrative facilities at each location. The facilities are designed to use 114,000 
gallons of water per day. Through the recycling of water only 25,000 gallons of potable 
water, per day is actually drawn for the supply system, an 82% savings in water 
usage. These facilities allow for 280,000 gallons of fuel to be stored in underground 
tanks on-site.
BUILDING AND TRAIN SYSTEMS:
RCC: The RCC building utilizes various management and customer service related 
systems that include: multi-user flight information displays (MUFIDS), and a build-
ing management system that monitors and/ or controls HVAC, chiller, escalators and 
Updated CPTC enhances passenger service for the growing number of travelers.

smoke detectors. The daylight harvesting system monitors and adjusts light levels 
based on outdoor ambient light. The security system monitors the status and usage 
of automated external defibrillators with CCTV verification of unit removal and usage. 
Twin large smoke control fans provide for removal of smoke throughout the RCC build-
ing. Fire sprinkler system provides coverage for almost 100% of the RCC.
APM: The APM Train includes the following systems:
»  Six two-car aluminum alloy car-body Mitsubishi “Crystal Mover” rubber tire APMs 
with AC induction motors with a design top speed of 43 mph. Able to move 2,700 
passengers per hour.
»  Power Distribution System (PDS) to supply conditioned electrical power to

PARTNERING WITH STAKEHOLDERS:
that were used on this 
The Owner was a strong advocate of partnering as a means of fostering communica-
project to facilitate oversight, 
tion and cooperation among project stakeholders. Of great concern to our Team were 
monitoring, documentation, 
the interface requirements between the APM guide-way being built by the DBOM 
negotiation, and a successful 
contractor and the RCC being built by the CM@R contractor. We held numerous plan-
conclusion.
ning sessions to discuss turn-over dates for select areas and turn-over conditions to 
avoid potential claims from either contractor. These planning and coordination meet-
ings helped to keep all parties informed and to ensure a smooth flow. All parties made 
an attempt to resolve problems at the operational level before elevating for executive 
resolution.
RCC: Our Team held several meetings with the designer, the CM@R contractor, and 
the Owner to develop a partnership agreement detailing how we would proceed. In 
addition, we held weekly issues resolution meetings designed to facilitate resolution of 
outstanding RFIs, submittals, unforeseen conditions, and design changes to ensure an 
unencumbered process.
APM: By its very nature, DBOM is a unique process in that the designer is resident 
under the building contractor and that the Best and Final Offer governs how much the 
Owner and its representative can affect the process without incurring significant cost. 
From the start, our Team developed a communications protocol to discuss design, 
progress, schedule, and interface issues with the CM@R contractor. Based primarily 
on the communications protocol, many potential claims were avoided.
APPROACH TO CONFLICT RESOLUTION:
We worked with our client to develop a hierarchy for conflict resolution that was 
employed on both the RCC and the APM projects. As with all issues, the project team 
worked closely with the specific contractor to seek resolution at the field level first. 
If resolved, the applicable contractual documents (change orders memorandum, etc.) 
were put in place. If not resolvable at the field/project level, we would seek resolution

SCHEDULE SUCCESSES:
 Construction Notice to Proceed

for clearing and grubbing of 
the 99-acre Rental Car Center 
site on July 5, 2005. Working 
in conjunction with the

progress meeting to assess 
schedule, budget and scope on 
the site grading project.

opposing views on an issue and debate the contractual merits of each position. The 
Less scope and an aggressive 
goal of our process was to avoid filing formal claims by resolving issues at the lowest 
approach to construction 
possible level.
progress and quality helped 
greatly in achieving substantial 
completion of the RCC 63 days  DELIVERING QUALITY SERVICE:
ahead of schedule. The ConRAC Program was a major undertaking which required a high-level of qual-
ity control by the contractors, as well as continued quality assurance from our Team 
in order to provide a facility that is representative of the General Manager’s vision for 
“exceeding customer expectations” through services and facilities. Our primary goal 
as a Team was to provide the best quality service by adhering to Best Practices within 
our industry. These practices are incorporated into the Jacobs JVEPSSM (Jacobs Value 
Enhancing PracticesSM) that were used on this project to facilitate oversight, monitor-
ing, documentation, negotiation, and a successful conclusion. 
COMPLEXITY:
Individually the RCC project components were not overly complicated. However, when 
combined together, and constructed concurrently with the APM projects, the interde-
pendence of the story and schedule among multiple design teams, various contractors, 
project delivery methods, and inter-dependent milestone/delivery dates added several 
layers of complexity.
For example, on the DBOM contract, there were interface requirements between the 
guide-way and other construction projects. There were state-of-the-art requirements 
for the central control room for train monitoring and control; turn-over requirements to 
minimize schedule impacts; unforeseen conditions in excavating, forming, and plac-
ing concrete footers for the columns; design requirements for the curved steel beams; 
traffic coordination requirements to span a major interstate; coordination requirements 
for “around-airport” operations that could not be affected for construction of the CPTC

the overall project schedule, enabled our project Team to anticipate potential problems 
with the CM@R project and other ongoing component projects.
APM: As with the RCC, the move to a web-based project management system 
(Expedition to Contract Manager) and the use of a common scheduling database made 
coordination on this project much more efficient. In addition, the DBOM contrac-
tor employed several visual aids to demonstrate the flow of the guide-way and train 
systems using Autocad.
DELIVERING CUSTOMER SERVICE EXCELLENCE:
The General Manager’s goal for the ConRAC was to provide airport users with a 
pleasant experience that reflects the services of a “Best in Class” airport. In addition 
to providing a central location for all rental car services, the APM system provides an 
environmentallyfriendly solution to pollution and traffic bottlenecks caused by numer-
ous buses circulating the airport.
To meet this goal, the Owner selected our Team to successfully deliver components 
that comprised the overall ConRAC Program. Our role was to develop and implement a 
team approach to delivering ConRAC components on-time and within budget and meet 
or exceed quality expectations.
The continuous oversight our Team provided across the multiple project components, 
as well as the activities described below, were keys to success in the delivery of the

Our high level of customer service was a direct result of:
»  Our inspectors moved from project site to project site as needed to convey critical 
information to key field individuals as appropriate.
»  Our Management Team always maintained a highlevel overview of project issues 
and how they interrelated across the projects, and could convey those concerns to 
the Owner for needed action.

ASSIGNMENT #2: North Sea-Tac (NSTAR) Airport Renovation 
Program, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Seattle, WA
GENERAL DESCRIPTION/SCOPE OF PROJECT
The North Sea-Tac Airport Renovation (NorthSTAR) Program is a $490M airport 
renovation program encompassing the entire north end of Seattle-Tacoma International 
Airport. Created in response to Alaska Air Group’s desire for ‘curb-to-gate’ improve-
ments in passenger service and experience, the program’s objectives are to consoli-
date Alaska Air Group’s operation in the North Satellite terminal and not only renovate 
the satellite facility but provide improvements in passenger processing through the 
north Main Terminal and Concourses C and D; this includes updating wayfinding to get 
passengers from the terminal to the curb for access to the Consolidated Rental Car 
Facility busing system. Projects currently in development include renovations to the 
North Satellite, refurbishment of Baggage Systems and Main Terminal Improvements, 
and modifications to the Satellite Train System lobbies.
We (Jacobs) were selected as the NorthSTAR program manager providing project 
controls, aviation project management expertise, and staff augmentation for the dura-
tion of the NorthSTAR Program (expected to end in 2018). Our team is also providing 
subject matter expertise in the areas of aviation planning and design management, 
tenant improvements, construction management, and overall program coordination. 
Prior to providing services for this program, we delivered project controls support to 
the $420M Consolidated Rental Car Facility program at SeaTac, which opened in June 
2012.

8.9 WOMAN AND MINTORITY OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE (W/MBE) 
PARTICIPATION
It is the policy of the Authority that W/MBEs as defined herein will have full and fair opportunities to compete and 
participate in the performance of all non-federally funded projects or in the purchase of goods and services procured 
by the Authority. It is anticipated that there will be opportunities for W/MBE participation as part of these program 
management related professional staffing augmentation services. At this time, the specific amount of services required 
by the Authority is unknown. Therefore, no Letters of Intent will be required at this time. As each scope is developed for 
a particular work order, the Respondent will be required to submit project specific W/MBE participation information to 
the Authority as part of their scope along with a completed and signed Letter of Intent for each W/MBE firm proposed 
on that work order. The cumulative W/MBE participation on all work orders issued must achieve the overall expectancy 
as listed in Paragraph A below.
A.  A W/MBE expectancy has been established for the Agreement. The Respondent must assure and demonstrate in 
their response that they will subcontract to certified W/MBEs at least 10% of the total dollar amount earned on the 
Agreement, or clearly demonstrate in a manner acceptable to the Authority its good faith efforts to obtain W/MBE 
participation. The selected Respondent’s W/MBE commitment will be incorporated into the Agreement and will be 
enforceable under the terms of the Agreement.
B.  Certification of Eligible W/MBEs: Only W/MBEs certified as a woman-owned or minority-owned business by 
Hillsborough County, the City of Tampa, State of Florida Department of Management Services Office of Supplier 
Diversity (OSD) or as a Disadvantaged Business Enterprise certified under the Florida Unified Certification Program 
(FLUCP) pursuant to 49 CFR Part 26 will count toward the W/MBE expectancy set forth herein.
C.  To demonstrate Respondent’s commitment to meet the W/MBE expectancy established, each Respondent must 
complete and submit with their response Appendix H, entitled Woman and Minority Owned Business Enterprise 
Assurance and Participation.
D.  Good Faith Efforts: If Respondent fails to meet the W/MBE expectancy set out above, Respondent must clearly 
demonstrate in its response in a manner acceptable to Authority its good faith efforts to do so. “Good Faith 
Efforts” are those efforts that could reasonably be expected to result in W/MBE expectancy attainment by a 
Respondent who aggressively and actively seeks to obtain W/MBE participation. In determining whether or not the 
Respondent has made such good faith efforts to meet the expectancy, the Authority will consider the factors listed 
in the W/MBE Policy.
E.  Failure to meet the above W/MBE expectancy or to satisfy any necessary good faith effort requirements will render 
the response as non-responsive. Non-responsive responses will not be evaluated.
Respondents are encouraged to refer to the Authority’s W/MBE Policy which is posted on the Authority’s website: www.
tampaairport.com; Airport Business/Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE). Links to the various websites that have 
directories of certified W/MBE firms are also available on the Authority’s website.
