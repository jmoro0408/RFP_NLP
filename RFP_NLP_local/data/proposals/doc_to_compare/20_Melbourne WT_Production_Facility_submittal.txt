Jackson Street Tampa, Florida 33602 (813) 274-7104The City of Tampa DLT WTP is a 120-mgd surface WTP that treats high-organic and turbidity Hillsborough River water. Jacobs designed the 40-mgd Actiflo expansion in 2001 that included adding ozone and biological activated carbon (BAC)/sand dual-media filters. Jacobs is currently designing the expansion and replacement of the high service pump station. The improvements design also changes the existing clearwell and piping configuration to improve DLTWTF staff’s ability to maintain the clearwells, eliminate hydraulic restrictions, enhance backwash source/control, improve chemical mixing, extend disinfection contact time, and increase potable water storage volume. Joe Elarde, Lead Process Designer and Permitting Tao Fu, Lead Process Mechanical Designer Russell Ford, Quality Control Reviewer Currently completing 90 percent design with construction mobilization anticipated in late 2020. Hillsborough River water is split-treated with Actiflo (40-mgd) and conventional coagulation/flocculation/ sedimentation (80-mgd) before joint treatment by ozone and BAC-capped dual-media gravity filters. Post treatment includes chlorine contact, ammonia addition, and high service pumping. Process Upgrades and Equipment Replacement at Choa Chu Kang Waterworks Public Utilities Board Nguyen Phuong Hanh (Ms) Senior EngineerPhone: +65 9723 8040Jacobs designed upgrades to the existing treatment plant to make it more robust, primarily in terms of increased organic loading and incidental spikes of micro-constituents brought about by ongoing urbanization. Upgrades included low pressure membranes, the first full-scale ceramic membrane installation at a municipal potable water plant in the world, procured via competitive life cycle costing selection criteria. The upgraded process provides a robust multi-barrier protection against pathogens, per the US EPA Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule. Project included the replacement of aged equipment and structures. Plant shutdowns were limited both in duration and capacity through detailed planning upfront and careful construction sequencing. Extensive bench tests were performed to evaluate Taste & Odor (MIB and Geosmin) removal efficiency with ozone and an advanced oxidation process while minimizing bromate formation. Russell Ford, Process Lead Jesus Garcia, Principal Technologist Construction completed in 2017. Surface water from the western catchment basin stored in multiple reservoirs, is treated with a conventional coagulation/flocculation/ sedimentation (100-mgd) plant that was expanded with low pressure oxidant-resistant ceramic membranes, ozone, and BAC contactors. City of Melbourne – RFQ for Professional Engineering Services Water Treatment and Water Production Facility ImprovementsFORM DsdiukLineCity of Melbourne – RFQ for Professional Engineering Services Water Treatment and Water Production Facility Improvements PROJECT APPROACH – GRAVITY FILTER SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS Describe in detail your firm’s approach to successful completion of this project using the remainder of this page and a maximum of one additional page (8½ x 11”). Include a discussion of specialized skills, knowledge and expertise of your project team, which will be utilized to complete the project. FORM F-1 The City operates two treatment plants co-located along Lake Washington Road, known as John A. Buckley Surface Water Treatment Plant (SWTP) and Joe Mullins Reverse Osmosis (RO) WTP. The Rapid Gravity Filter (RGF) System is part of the SWTP that treats surface water from Lake Washington. Settled and ozonated water is dosed with sodium hydroxide with a target pH of 8.1 and gravitates to the biologically active RGF filters. The dual-media filter beds consist of 60 inches of 1.3 mm effective size (ES) GAC over 12 inches of 0.5 mm ES silica sand, supported on FRP Leopold type ‘S’ block underdrains with IMS caps.  In 2001, the RGF System was added during the Phase 1 improvements project, which also covered a new raw water pump station, Actiflo, and a blend/CT tank and transfer pump station. Four of the six filters were refurbished while two new filters were added. In 2007, ozonation and a backwash pump station were added during the Phase 2 improvements project. Both phases were designed by CH2M (now Jacobs), with records still available and design engineers still with the firm and included on the team. GAC media is replaced every 12 to 18 months due to media fouling caused by insufficient backwashing. Also, some equipment in the filter gallery (e.g. obsolete valve actuators, ultrasonic level & turbidity instruments) has been replaced. Lastly, a PLC/SCADA replacement project for the SWTP is currently ongoing, updating RGF System controls. The filtration rate is 4.0 gpm/sf at design flow with one filter out of operation and empty bed contact time approximately 10 minutes. The media filters provide multiple purposes, including residual turbidity and organics removal and micro-constituent barrier that may be present in the source water. Typical run time at current average flows of 13 mgd is around 60 to 70 hours. When one filter is down for backwash or maintenance, run times decrease rapidly and filtered water turbidities increase. Backwashing is performed mostly manually and is achieved by a combined air-water wash with low water backwash rates, followed by rinse with high water backwash rates. This rinse rate has to be limited to around 17 gpm/sf, as opposed to the design rate of 25 gpm/sf, due to a restriction in the filter drainage lines. Filters share a common submerged inlet with flow control through a flow meter and control valve in the filter effluent pipe. Based on the condition assessment performed as part of the Master Plan, the concrete filter structures have numerous cracks in elevated concrete slabs and walls. The four filters refurbished in 2001 show several areas where spalled concrete was patched, and leaking cracks repaired with injections. The two newer filters are observed to be leaking at construction joints. There has been indication that the underdrains may have deficiencies after 20 years of continuous operations, and it is suggested that a detailed inspection and repairs or replacement (R&R) be done during the next media replacement project. Butterfly water and air valves in the filter gallery are leaking water, but due to limited space and piping fittings arrangement, valve replacement cannot be done without temporarily seizing operation of a block of filters, as filter influent and filter effluent pipes are all connected. Past filter gallery flooding has negatively affected the condition of mechanical and electrical equipment. Two de-humidifiers are currently obsolete and atmospheric conditions are hot and humid, causing further wear and tear of the equipment.  Despite the condition, the performance of the filters has been relatively good, with filtered water turbidity around 0.1 NTU and residual iron less than 0.01 mg/L. Filtered water from the SWTP is blended with permeate from the RO WTP before final disinfection with first sodium hypochlorite and then formation of chloramines with dosing anhydrous ammonia. Post treatment chemicals include carbon dioxide and sodium hydroxide for alkalinity recovery in the finished water.   Because of above issues, the RGF System received the third highest risk score (after ozone, degasifier & scrubbers) during the condition assessment performed as part of the Master Plan. The Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) covers the following components: (A) increase backwash drain capacity ($1.3 m) – ongoing project, (B) replace filter valves, remaining actuators, electrical panels, flow meters and cabling, and dehumidifiers in the filter gallery ($2.8 m), (C) inspect and provide R&R to the filter underdrains and make concrete repairs to concrete structures ($1.2 m) and (D) add new gravity or pressure filters to establish appropriate system redundancy ($8.6 m). City of Melbourne – RFQ for Professional Engineering Services Water Treatment and Water Production Facility Improvements As part of our response to this RFQ, we have compared Melbourne’s RGF System against newer biologically active gravity media filters and talked to our subject matter experts who work in different geographical areas and have experience with design, startup, and operation of RGF Systems under different conditions and in different process arrangements. Based on these discussions, we conclude that the City operates a relatively conservative RGF System that requires urgent R&R work and needs expansion. Also, the City is in a similar situation with the Actiflo Treatment Process, consisting of two undersized, parallel trains. Our overarching, innovative approach to the SWTP improvements covers the following sequential steps: 1. Execute a pilot testing program to verify suggested Actiflo improvements, optimize filter performance, study pre-filtration for the preferred long-term SWTP solution, and review the feasibility of backwash recovery with membranes and UV.2. Expand the RGF System with additional filtration capacity. This allows a block of existing filters to be taken out of operation for a limited duration for valve replacement.3. Provide urgent R&R to the existing RGF System as per the CIP and optimize the filter performance. Once complete, this allows one Actiflo train to be taken offline, while relying on an expanded and refurbished RGF System for capturing floc carry-over.4. Make enhancements to each Actiflo train while offline, covering larger de-sludge pumps, extend sedimentation area, and provide urgent R&R to concrete structure and internal equipment.The main benefit of this approach is to execute the urgent Actiflo and filter R&R program, while avoiding the expense of a new third Actiflo train that will not be required in the preferred long-term SWTP solution for the City. The refurbished and new media filters will however be reused in the future. We have assumed that the City will finish the design and construction of the filter drain improvements project in Fiscal Year 2021 so that the filters can be backwashed at the intended design rinse rate and media fouling can be limited, thus extending the GAC life. The project includes the removal of the rectangular clarifier with associated rapid mix and flocculation chambers for locating new process equipment. In step 2), gravity media filters may be re-purposed in the future as roughing filters upstream of a dual membrane treatment system, possibly replacing Actiflo in the future, or re-purposed as post treatment GAC absorbers. The design of the additional filters may be similar to the existing RGF System in terms of hydraulics, filtration area and rate, and filter media size and depth. Alternatively, if pressure filters are considered, they may be designed with a similar contact time but with a reduced filtration rate, finer media, and shallower depth. As part of this solution, we suggest performing pilot testing with a series of filter columns to test different filter media designs under different arrangements and water quality conditions, as mentioned above. This includes verifying benefits of adding a nutrient to improve the biological filter performance by optimizing mass ratio for Carbon (bioavailable) : Nitrogen : Phosphate. In step 3), the critical aspect is providing proper isolation of each filter from the main process so that R&R work can be executed while that media filter is offline. The filter influent channel and filter effluent pipe are connected with all filters without intermediate isolation means. Therefore, the first step is to install temporary or permanent isolation valves and gates during a short plant outage so that a block of filters can be taken offline and each filter influent and filter effluent valve can be replaced. One further innovative suggestion is to provide separate treatment for the dirty filter backwash water and return the treated backwash water back into the process. One option the City may want to explore is using low pressure membrane filtration and UV disinfection, implemented successfully by this team for the City of Parksville, City of North Bay, and Windsor Lake in Canada. This provides an effective backwash treatment, allowing treated backwash waters to be recycled downstream of the media filters, subject to regulatory approval. It will also provide the team with experience using membrane processes on this surface water, which are integral to the long-term SWTP solution for the City. This revised recycle flow arrangement will reduce flows through the entire process, minimize pH swings of Actiflo feed water, and improve the overall treatment performance. We would be delighted to further explain our suggested sequence of implementation of SWTP improvements and explore our innovative filter ideas described above in an oral interview. ===+++ end +++===City of Melbourne – RFQ for Professional Engineering Services Water Treatment and Water Production Facility Improvements PROJECT APPROACH – ENHANCEMENT OF ACTIFLO TREATMENT PROCESS Describe in detail your firm’s approach to successful completion of this project using the remainder of this page and a maximum of one additional page (8½ x 11”). Include a discussion of specialized skills, knowledge and expertise of your project team, which will be utilized to complete the project. FORM F-2 Similar to the RGF System, the Actiflo® Treatment Process (Actiflo) is part of the City’s SWTP that treats surface water from Lake Washington. Raw water contains elevated levels of organic material, turbidity levels that can spike to 100 NTU during a storm, and moderate levels of hardness and alkalinity. Concentrations of organic material and minerals fluctuate during the year and follow wet and dry season patterns. Source water may also contain algae (producing taste & odor and Microcystis) and micro-constituents like simazine and is classified in Bin 1 of the Long-Term 2 Enhanced SWTR, and therefore, no additional treatment for Cryptosporidium is needed.  In 2001, Actiflo was added as part of the Phase 1 improvements project while in 2007, ozonation was added as part of the Phase 2 improvements project. Both phases were designed by CH2M (now Jacobs). Many of the older basins were repurposed for treatment and/or storage of Actiflo underflows and dirty filter backwash waters. Since then, the City has replaced the polystyrene tube settlers with increased spacing due to solids blocking flows; changed to Philadelphia coagulation and maturation mixers with hydrofoil blades, TEFC motor, inverter-duty drives & desiccant dryers to improve performance and reduce breakdown frequency; and resized the hydrocyclones and retrofitted with appropriate materials, including urethane body, rubber lining and 304 SST support stand. The Water Champ coagulation mixing was discontinued. Performance has been relatively okay in terms of turbidity removal, but the system is sensitive to operational and maintenance issues (like failure of any component) and to source water quality changes due to limited overall detention time. Also, operating costs are high due to large amounts of ferric sulfate (average 150-200 mg/L) and sodium hydroxide (average 50-80 mg/L) being used. Even under average flows or under challenging source water conditions, suspended solids may carry over and settle in the ozone contactors and/or surface-blind the media filters. Dissolved iron originating from the coagulant also carries over, is oxidized by ozone and subsequently removed by the filters, causing additional solids loading and GAC media fouling. Actiflo is operated at a pH of 3.8-4.0 for optimal organics removal, and these conditions are aggressive to concrete structures and metal equipment. Currently, treated recycle water is returned upstream of the ferric sulfate injection at around 10% of the raw water flow. Recycle water has a fluctuating pH affecting the coagulation/clarification process. As a consequence of the 3-inch polystyrene tubes retrofit, each Actiflo train can only treat the design flow of 10-mgd under excellent raw water quality conditions, but that drops to around 6-7-mgd under challengingconditions. Also, because of having only two trains, the system’s firm capacity is only 7-10-mgd, less than theaverage production flow of 13-mgd. Failure of a mixer, sludge scraper, de-sludge pump, valve, orhydrocyclone will cause a shutdown of that Actiflo train, thus reducing the SWTP capacity. To keep up withthe high solids production in the sedimentation zone and to avoid solids carry-over, three (of the four)de-sludge pumps run continuously, resulting in higher underflows than was designed; e.g. underflows aretypically 7-8 percent of raw water flow as opposed to 4 percent as per design.Since 2001, Actiflo has made product improvements, of which some have been retrofitted in the existing facility, including larger diameter tubes, better and more reliable mixers, and better sized and more durable hydrocyclones. The detention times and mixing energy levels in the injection and maturation compartments have remained the same, however the current Actiflo product does not include an injection zone, as metal coagulation is typically performed in the upstream feed pipe. Also, sedimentation zones in the current Actiflo product are typically larger, therefore reducing sedimentation rates. Because of above issues, Actiflo received the fifth highest risk score (after ozone, degasifier & scrubbers, media filters and Canova pump station) during the Master Plan condition assessment. The CIP covers the following: (A) replace de-sludge pumps, valves and polystyrene tubes and recoat/repair scrapers and mixers ($0.9 m), (B) increase sedimentation area by modifying the concrete structure and replacing sludge scrapers and associated variable speed drives ($1.3 m), and (C), add a third Actiflo train with a rated capacity of       10-mgd to establish appropriate system redundancy ($5.9 m).City of Melbourne – RFQ for Professional Engineering Services Water Treatment and Water Production Facility Improvements As part of our response to this RFQ, we have compared the Melbourne design to later generation Actiflo systems (see below) and talked to our subject matter experts who were involved in these projects. As shown, the City operates a similar Actiflo System, but the retrofit with the larger diameter tubes has increased the projected loading rate and effectively reduced the sedimentation capacity.

First few steps in our suggested sequence is to execute a pilot testing program and then to improve and expand the existing RGF System so that a more resilient filtration system is available, capable of capturing iron and floc carry-over from Actiflo. Last step is to make R&R improvements to Actiflo and to correct the reduced sedimentation capacity caused by the larger tubes. This requires changes to the Actiflo internals and can only be done by taking an Actiflo train offline. As mentioned, we have engaged with our Actiflo experts who have experience in different geographical areas and with different source waters. Our innovative solutions include:  • Optimize maturation conditions by adding a Turbomix 304 SST draft tube around the flocculation mixer. This is now standard in the updated Actiflo product, improves maturation and sedimentation conditions, and is a relatively simple retrofit.• Improve coagulation conditions by introducing flash mixing conditions for ferric sulfate with adding a new static mixer in the raw water pipeline. This will improve coagulant efficiency and reduce iron carry over. As part of this solution, we suggest performing a series of jar tests under these conditions to optimize chemical doses, followed by confirmation in the pilot testing program.• Increase de-sludging capacity by replacing the existing de-sludge pumps with new, larger de-sludge pumps and associated valving and piping. Pump replacement was covered in the CIP, however we suggest upsizing to increase sand recirculation flows. This will improve de-sludge operations while reducing underflows and enhancing sedimentation conditions.• Increase sedimentation and projected tube area by sacrificing the injection zone and using that zone for maturation so that the wall between maturation and sedimentation compartments can be moved while maintaining the appropriate chute velocities and flocculation times. This can be considered in conjunction with maximizing tube length, considering blower backwashing and reconfiguring the arrangement and/or material of the tubes. The intent is to restore the projected surface loading and cross flow rates, as per the original design. This can be modelled and coordinated with Veolia. Although this solution has good potential, the modification requires a structural reconfiguration requiring an extended train shutdown.While the Actiflo internals are modified, it is suggested to perform other R&R work as per the CIP, including replacing or rehabilitating sludge scrapers and associated variable speed drives, re-oat mixers and other steel parts, and make repairs to the concrete structures. Our suggested sequence of implementation of SWTP improvements avoids the addition of the third Actiflo train, saving substantial capital expenditure. We would be delighted to further explain our suggested implementation sequence of SWTP improvements and explore our innovative Actiflo ideas described above in an oral interview. ===+++ end +++=== City of Melbourne – RFQ for Professional Engineering Services Water Treatment and Water Production Facility Improvements MINORITY BUSINESS ENTERPRISE State whether your firm or any firm to which you may subcontract services related to this project, is a certified minority business enterprise as defined by the Florida Small and Minority Business Assistance Act of 1985.

Hillsborough River water is split treated with Actiflo (40 mgd) and conventional coagulation/flocculation/ sedimentation (80 mgd) before joint treatment by ozone and BAC-capped dual-media gravity filters. Post treatment includes chlorine contact, ammonia addition and high service pumping.       Surface water from the western catchment basin, stored in multiple reservoirs, is treated with a conventional coagulation/flocculation/ sedimentation (100 mgd) plant that was expanded with low pressure oxidant-resistant ceramic membranes, ozone, and biologically-active carbon contactors.
