This experience, amplified with worldwide expertise in  aviation program management, will provide you the best assistance in the industry to ensure your vision as a vibrant aviation  gateway for Tampa Bay continues to be a reality.  Outstanding customer service is a goal we share with the Authority.  To  that end, our team has worked together previously and will provide the highest caliber personnel with the right technical  capabilities at the right time, to successfully supplement your staff and maximize your capital investments.   Jacobs as well as AECOM have had a major corporate presence in Tampa for 30+ years, and have a combined total of more  than 460 employees engaged in a multitude of business, community, and philanthropic endeavors throughout the Region.  TPA is our primary airport; our firms generate an estimated 1,500 enplanements per year as part of the economic impact of  our combined corporate presence in the area.

Our proposed Key Personnel are: Todd McClendon, Project Manager (Jacobs); Peter Elgohary, Project Controls Manager  (Jacobs); Jeffrey Weiner, AIA, Design Quality Assurance Manager (PGAL); and John Cordner, PE, Construction Quality  Assurance Manager (AECOM).

Work began with project  definition of a phased terminal replacement and expansion program,  extension of the two-level roadway access system, additional parking  facilities, central plant modernization and expansion, and airside  redevelopment.  When the program was confirmed, Jacobs managed  design and construction of the replacement terminal and central plant with  accompanying utility, road, and airside redevelopment, and with addition  of 2,800 structured parking spaces.  As the program matured, we  transitioned from a fully independent program management team to a staff  extension, supporting client management in the final stages of  construction, commissioning, and activation.  The program cost $352  million, and engaged terminal stakeholders, agencies, and special  participants such as the City Historic Commission and local artists to  achieve public goals for aesthetic quality in the facilities.  There were four  design teams and three general contractors, working under straight bid,  competitive sealed proposal, and construction manager at risk agreements.   UNIQUE FEATURES OF THE ASSIGNMENT OR  SPECIAL CONDITIONS   The heart of the terminal program was to replace a single level passenger  from the 1950s with a modern two-level terminal, while the older terminal  remained in service.  The footprints of the existing and replacement  terminals overlapped, and the extension of the two-level roadway required  major utility and apron reconstruction to adjust the grade of the  replacement terminal.

The adjacent existing terminal relied on many of the utilities being  relocated and replaced in the program, and we ensured continuity of  service for this terminal as well.    The 2,800 space parking structure bid 30% above the engineer’s final  estimate.  Since the procurement was by competitive sealed proposal, we  were able to negotiate with the builder to revise the scope of the contract,  and we expedited redesign by the architect to achieve a simpler, relocated  facility with improved construction access that delivered the required  spaces ahead of the original schedule for completion and within budget.

This project, the largest consolidated rental car facility  in operation today, is located on a 67-acre site near the airport and is accessed by a 1.5-mile  above-ground people mover, or APM, and an access road that crosses a major interstate, local  highway and a railroad. Program elements include two four-level garage structures totaling 2.8M  SF and 8,700 ready/return/storage spaces, a 140,000 SF customer terminal that accommodates 12  rental car agencies, and seven maintenance and storage areas, commonly known as QTA’s, or  Quick Turnaround Areas, that contain fueling, wash and maintenance facilities with 140 fuel  dispensers, 32 wash bays, and 16 light maintenance bays. Additional work elements include on- site roadways to support the facilities vehicular infrastructure and an extensive signage and  graphics package. The APM is the third stop on a system that connects the rental car center with  the central terminal area and the new Georgia International Convention Center, a true testament  to the public-private partnership between two neighboring cities and developers. PGAL was also  responsible for the design and oversight of rental car build-out for exclusive use areas. This  facility is seeking LEED certification.

Person’s Name:    Jeffrey A. Weiner, AIA    Detailed Assignment Participation and Responsibilities:  Jeff Weiner’s role for PGAL on this project was principal manager participating full-time from  beginning to end over a six year duration.  Jeff relocated to Atlanta and established PGAL’s  seventh regional office, employing 15 local Atlanta design professionals. Today, that office  remains in operation and serves as PGAL’s rental car planning studio home as well as their  southeastern (outside of Florida) base.    Jeff led the development of the overall project scope and fee for the Joint Venture Design Team,  inclusive of all project phases, components and deliverables. He was responsible for the  development of the project program, refining the planning document that had been developed  over the previous decade, and quickly helped align the project program, goals and budget.   Working closely with the City, the designated Program Management Team and the RAC  Industry, the Design Team, all managed by Jeff, created and issued a Program Design Manual  (PDM), that established the overall program (ConRAC facility and a connecting APM system to  the Terminal), budget and schedule that was used for building consensus among the numerous  stakeholders and created financial models for funding.      Jeff was responsible for preparing and presenting the project at various stages to the City, the  Airport’s Executive Committee, the RAC Industry and the project stakeholders.  He was able to  build upon his previous experience with large consolidated rental car facilities at Dallas/ Fort  Worth and Houston Intercontinental Airport’s as he directed the operational planning and  modeling for the largest consolidated rental car facility in operation today.  That operational  planning created a high-volume, vertical circulation solution that moves customers quickly and  efficiently through its four-level Customer Service Center and into its pair of four-level parking  structures split by the APM system. It also created a well-organized one-way loop road to  facilitate a high-volume of traffic and was also instrumental in defining a high-level of customer  services and equality among the participating rental car companies.          Jeff was responsible for the design efforts of more than 20 project consultants, coordination with  the Airport’s PM Team, the APM Design-Build Team and the Construction Manager.  Jeff also  led the Design Team in the overall Quality Assurance / Quality Control efforts, as well as the  value engineering effort with the Construction Manager to buyout the project without a  minimization of program, a difficult task with the then escalating costs of labor and materials  putting pressure on budgets and financing.  Jeff remains in close contact today with Airport staff  and the facility’s manager to understand the post-occupancy operational issues and to bring  lessons learned from the ATL ConRAC to future consolidated rental car projects.       8.2 D.

Constructed over  multiple phases, this facility will replace the existing rental car operations essentially in-place, as  the new facility will be built “on-top-of” the existing rental car sites within the Southwest  Service Area. The 49-acre site is the center for ground transportation operations at the Airport.  The environmentally friendly phased redevelopment includes a 4-level parking structure for  3,200 ready/return/storage spaces, a 120,000 SF customer terminal, and four limited maintenance  service areas for vehicular fleets. Additional elements of the program include multiple roadway  modifications to improve roadway and reduce terminal curb congestion, a bus access ramp that  supports the two-level customer terminal and a unified common busing system for all of BOS,  and improved facilities for the Airport’s taxi, bus and limousine pools. In addition to a complex  building program, this development consists of an extensive environmental mitigation measures  for greenhouse gases, energy consumption and water quality/ usage. Stakeholder benefits allow  the project to buffer the adjacent neighborhoods from ground transportation operations and  create a definition of airport boundaries within the residential community. This project is  pursuing LEED Gold Certification.     8.2 D.

This multi-phase and multi-year effort allowed Massport to  finalize their long awaiting redevelopment plan for the Southwest Service Area, home for all  ground transportation functions, and obtain a consensus of planning, phasing, design, schedule  and budget from the RAC Industry.  Jeff led this effort and coordinated a large, multi-discipline  team of local consultants, along with the various stakeholder departments within Massport,  including Environmental Planning & Design, Finance, Airport Business Office, Capital  Programs, Community Outreach and Ground Transportation.  Key deliverables during the phase  included the development of the project program, its rightsizing of elements to align with the  budget, and refinement of the planning document that allowed for project acceleration.    Following the completion of the initial phase for environmental permitting and concept design,  PGAL and PB reversed contractual roles, with Jeff (PGAL) remaining as the Buildings Design  Manager, RAC Planner and Architect of Record (AOR) for the ConRAC, again coordinating  multiple design consultants, leading the overall design team’s Quality Assurance/Quality Control  efforts, and collaborating with all project stakeholders, including Massport, the CMR (Suffolk  Construction), the RAC Industry and the neighboring community. Jeff was also responsible for  the numerous rental car enabling projects (National/Alamo/Enterprise consolidation into one  operational area, Hertz relocation and reconfiguration of site and Budget modifications) that  were required for project phasing.  Again, Jeff (PGAL) served as Design Manager, RAC Planner  and AOR for these three enabling projects.     Jeff was responsible for preparing and presenting the project at various stages to Massport, the  RAC Industry and the project stakeholders. The design of the facility at operational planning  created a high-volume, space  that moves customers quickly and efficiently through the  Customer Service Center and into the four-level parking structure. It also created a well- organized one-way loop road to facilitate a high-volume of traffic was also instrumental in  defining a high-level of customer services and equality among the participating rental car  companies.           8.2 D.

Person’s Name:    Jeffrey A. Weiner, AIA    Other Experience and Qualities Relevant to Assignment:  Jeff has spent the better part of his 30 years of professional practice and experience managing  and designing parking garage and transportation related projects.  In fact, he has dedicated the  previous 15 years working almost exclusively on on-airport rental car facilities for both airport  authorities and RAC companies, travelling extensively and taking advantage of the opportunity  to experience just about every rental car facility, whether consolidated or not, in the country.      Jeff brings a unique understanding of this particular project type, along with an ability to work  with and through large teams and multiple tenants, and is able to build consensus among  competitors within the RAC Industry and the Owner / Tenant relationship -- this is Jeff's strength  and how he adds value to a team and a client.  Jeff also understands not only the more traditional  roles a consultant performs on a project, like Quality Assurance Management, but the non- traditional roles of business planning issues, alternate methods of construction, schedule and  budget compliance at all levels, and the need for collaboration and consensus building.    Jeff is a member of the American Association of Airport Executives and is often called upon to  speak at their annual Rental Car Workshop, offering his insight into the planning and design of  consolidated rental car facilities while stressing the importance of collaboration between airports  and the RAC Industry that is needed to achieve a successful project.

The Jacobs team  designated key personnel, Todd McClendon and Jeff  Weiner, led the overall development, design, construction  and commissioning of this, the largest facility of its kind.  Additionally, because the Program was such a major  undertaking, it required constant communication and  partnership between project stakeholders, as well as a  high-level of quality control by the contractors and our  team. One of our primary concerns was the interface  requirements between the APM guide-way (built by the  DBOM contractor) and the RCC (built by the CM@R  contractor).

The CM effort was executed with a blended staff of Jacobs and AECOM  integrated with the Department of Aviation team.  The RCC is a four-story building, with the fourth-story serving as the destination APM  Train Customer Service Center Station stop for rental agencies. It is an open, airy  area with connecting escalators, elevators, bathrooms, multi-user flight information  displays (MUFIDS), ticketing kiosks, and station art. It was built by the CM@R con- tractor Austin-PRAD (a Joint Venture comprised of Austin Commercial, LP and Prad  Group, Inc.). The second and third floors include rental agency customer service space  totaling 540 linear feet of counter space for 13 different agencies. The four-story  atrium receives natural daylight through a 27,500-SF North-facing glass curtain-wall.  A daylight harvesting lighting system provides consistent illumination during daylight,  night time and overcast weather.  The RCC is connected at both the North face and the South face to the parking decks  via three two-story and two single-story open-air pedestrian bridges, spanning 90 feet  each. The fourth level of the RCC is the APM station platform, more commonly referred  to as the Customer Service Center (CSC) Station.

PROGRAM MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT AT TAMPA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (SOLICITATION #: 13-411-021)  8.3 Respondent’s Experience in Work of Comparable   Scope and Complexity  Section 8.3 – Page 6  OUR APPROACH TO MANAGING CONSTRUCTION: Our approach to managing construction was to establish an environment where all  parties shared in the success of the project. The various members each had distinct  responsibilities which had to be blended into a comprehensive team. Our Team’s suc- cess or failure relied on the efforts of all team members, and this focus was never lost  during the four-year construction process. Since the project had several major compo- nents, timely communication was essential across all the project components.  This was facilitated through progress meetings, issue resolution meetings, project site  walk-throughs, executive level meetings, and daily conversations between contractors  and our Team. We provided comprehensive leadership addressing six primary areas of  management to include:   » General construction management services  » Project administration  » Project controls  » Quality assurance/quality controls  » Project documentation  » Safety  DELIVERY METHOD:  The ConRAC Program was delivered using several conventional construction methods.  The HACM Joint Venture Team, led by Jacobs, was responsible for providing Agency  Construction Management services to the Atlanta Department of Aviation. The ConRAC  Program was comprised of two major components: (1) mass grading, construction of  the RCCsite, customer service center station, and rental vehicles support facilities; and  (2) construction of the APM with associated guide-way, train stations, maintenance  and storage facility.   » The RCC was constructed using the Construction Manager at Risk (CM@R) delivery  method.  “Since the beginning of the  Hartsfield Development  Program, the construction  management team led by  Jacobs has served the client  extremely efficiently and economically, adjusting to  the changing needs of the  program. The airport has  been able to depend on a  large and responsive talent  pool that Jacobs is capable of  delivering.”  – Stephen Morris, Director, Central Passenger Terminal  Complex  (8.3 ATTACHMENT – PAGE 2 OF 12)  RCC provides a convenient, centralized car rental location that helps minimize traffic congestion.    PROGRAM MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT AT TAMPA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (SOLICITATION #: 13-411-021)  8.3 Respondent’s Experience in Work of Comparable   Scope and Complexity  Section 8.3 – Page 7   » The APM was a Design-Build-Operate & Maintain (DBOM) contract. Midway  through the project, a change order was issued on the DBOM contract which  included the construction of two additional train stations. The stations change order  was a traditional design/bid/build delivery method that was constructed within the  duration of the base contract. Under the terms of the contract, the sub-contractor,  Mitsubishi and Sumitomo, would operate and maintain the APM system facility for  the first five years after final acceptance.  As a part of the ConRAC Program, our Team was also responsible for providing CM  oversight as the Owner’s Representative for the projects detailed below:  APM Train System: The DBOM contractor constructed the APM Train System which  services three stations: (1) The Customer Service Center Station; (2) The Gateway Sta- tion; and (3) The Central Passenger Terminal Complex (CPTC) Station. The APM Train  Systems is a 1.5 mile long, dual-lane elevated guideway that operates on a pinched- loop system. The initial capacity of the APM was 2,700 persons/per hour/per day; the  ultimate capacity is 5,100 persons/per hour/per day. There are 2.5 minutes of headway  per station, totalling 10 minutes, round trip.  Gateway Station: Also constructed by the DBOM contractor, the Gateway Station is a  9,600 SF, five-story, 85-foot-high enclosed train station that serves the Georgia Inter- national Convention Center and is the intermediate stop between the CSC (Customer  Service Center) station and CPTC Station. The building is supported independently  from the guide-way by concrete columns with conditioned public areas, enclosed by  metal panels with a sloping membrane roof. The platform level consists of glass for  natural lighting with curved ceiling and terrazzo flooring.  Central Passenger Terminal Complex (CPTC) Station: Also constructed by the  DBOM contractor the CPTC Station is a 19,970 SF, two-story, 50-foot-high train  station that serves the Central Passenger Terminal Complex and Ground Transporta- tion Center. The building is supported independently from the guide-way by concrete  columns with conditioned public areas, enclosed by metal panels with a membrane  roof. The platform is enclosed and served by stainless steel and glass platform station  doors, architectural terrazzo, along with vertical conveyances and granite stairs.  New APM integrated into Gateway Train Station to provide ease of travel for visitors.

The ground floor includes a loading dock, shipping and receiving  area, Power Distribution System (PDS) substation, DC switchboard\UPS\mechanical\ electrical space, and elevator rooms. The upper floor consists of the maintenance  area, office spaces, and control equipment room. An automatic train wash building is  located near the switch and stable yard.   Mass site grading: Site preparation for the 99-acre RCC site began in late October  2005. Site preparation included clearing and grubbing, earthwork, miscellaneous  demolition, utilities termination, utility relocation, erosion and sediment control, tempo- rary fencing, storm detention, and retaining walls. Work also included installation of a  permanent perimeter fence as well as sanitary and storm sewer trunk lines.  Parking Decks: There are two cast-in-place parking decks which, in total, have more  than 8,700 parking spaces and 2.8M SF of space.  Quick Turnaround Areas (QTAs): Seven QTAs were built to provide the rental agen- cies with full-service facilities all in one location. The seven different QTAs are used by  13 different rental agencies. Altogether, the QTAs provide 4,000 ground-level storage  spaces for vehicles, 136 fuel and vacuum areas, 20 carwash bays with water recovery  systems and 24 vehicle maintenance and service bays. There are also storage spaces  and administrative facilities at each location. The facilities are designed to use 114,000  gallons of water per day. Through the recycling of water only 25,000 gallons of potable  water, per day is actually drawn for the supply system, an 82% savings in water  usage. These facilities allow for 280,000 gallons of fuel to be stored in underground  tanks on-site.  BUILDING AND TRAIN SYSTEMS: RCC: The RCC building utilizes various management and customer service related  systems that include: multi-user flight information displays (MUFIDS), and a build- ing management system that monitors and/ or controls HVAC, chiller, escalators and   (8.3 ATTACHMENT – PAGE 4 OF 12)  VALUE ADDED:   �  Three of our four proposed  key team members (Todd  McClendon, Jeffrey Weiner,  and John Cordner) worked  together on this ConRAC  program to successfully deliver  both the 137,000 SF Rental Car  Center (RCC) and the 1.5 mile  long Automated People Mover  (APM). These team members  will utilize their combined  knowledge and experience  on this program to augment  Hillsborough County Aviation  Authority’s professional team.  Updated CPTC enhances passenger service for the growing number of travelers.

The daylight harvesting system monitors and adjusts light levels  based on outdoor ambient light. The security system monitors the status and usage  of automated external defibrillators with CCTV verification of unit removal and usage.  Twin large smoke control fans provide for removal of smoke throughout the RCC build- ing. Fire sprinkler system provides coverage for almost 100% of the RCC.  APM: The APM Train includes the following systems:   » Six two-car aluminum alloy car-body Mitsubishi “Crystal Mover” rubber tire APMs  with AC induction motors with a design top speed of 43 mph. Able to move 2,700  passengers per hour.   » Power Distribution System (PDS) to supply conditioned electrical power to  the guide-way and support facilities and auxiliaries for trains with substations  transforming and rectifying the primary 9.8KV power to 750V DC.   » Automatic Train Control System (ATC) consists of three second-tier subsystems:  Automatic Train Protection (ATP) provides all safety-critical functions, Automatic  Train Operation (ATO) provides all automatic-mode train operations, and Automatic  Train Status (ATS) monitors system status and overall operation.  PARTNERING WITH STAKEHOLDERS: The Owner was a strong advocate of partnering as a means of fostering communica- tion and cooperation among project stakeholders. Of great concern to our Team were  the interface requirements between the APM guide-way being built by the DBOM  contractor and the RCC being built by the CM@R contractor. We held numerous plan- ning sessions to discuss turn-over dates for select areas and turn-over conditions to  avoid potential claims from either contractor. These planning and coordination meet- ings helped to keep all parties informed and to ensure a smooth flow. All parties made  an attempt to resolve problems at the operational level before elevating for executive  resolution.  RCC: Our Team held several meetings with the designer, the CM@R contractor, and  the Owner to develop a partnership agreement detailing how we would proceed. In  addition, we held weekly issues resolution meetings designed to facilitate resolution of  outstanding RFIs, submittals, unforeseen conditions, and design changes to ensure an  unencumbered process.  APM: By its very nature, DBOM is a unique process in that the designer is resident  under the building contractor and that the Best and Final Offer governs how much the  Owner and its representative can affect the process without incurring significant cost.  From the start, our Team developed a communications protocol to discuss design,  progress, schedule, and interface issues with the CM@R contractor. Based primarily  on the communications protocol, many potential claims were avoided.  APPROACH TO CONFLICT RESOLUTION: We worked with our client to develop a hierarchy for conflict resolution that was  employed on both the RCC and the APM projects. As with all issues, the project team  worked closely with the specific contractor to seek resolution at the field level first.  If resolved, the applicable contractual documents (change orders memorandum, etc.)  were put in place. If not resolvable at the field/project level, we would seek resolution   Our goal as a Team was  to provide the best quality  service by adhering to  Best Practices within our  industry. These practices are  incorporated into the Jacobs  JVEPSSM (Jacobs Value  Enhancing PracticesSM)  that were used on this  project to facilitate oversight,  monitoring, documentation,  negotiation, and a successful  conclusion.  (8.3 ATTACHMENT – PAGE 5 OF 12)    PROGRAM MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT AT TAMPA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (SOLICITATION #: 13-411-021)  8.3 Respondent’s Experience in Work of Comparable   Scope and Complexity  Section 8.3 – Page 10  through the use of quarterly, or (as needed) executive meetings, where senior con- tractor personnel, representatives of our Team, and the client would meet to discuss  opposing views on an issue and debate the contractual merits of each position. The  goal of our process was to avoid filing formal claims by resolving issues at the lowest  possible level.  DELIVERING QUALITY SERVICE: The ConRAC Program was a major undertaking which required a high-level of qual- ity control by the contractors, as well as continued quality assurance from our Team  in order to provide a facility that is representative of the General Manager’s vision for  “exceeding customer expectations” through services and facilities. Our primary goal  as a Team was to provide the best quality service by adhering to Best Practices within  our industry. These practices are incorporated into the Jacobs JVEPSSM (Jacobs Value  Enhancing PracticesSM) that were used on this project to facilitate oversight, monitor- ing, documentation, negotiation, and a successful conclusion.   COMPLEXITY: Individually the RCC project components were not overly complicated. However, when  combined together, and constructed concurrently with the APM projects, the interde- pendence of the story and schedule among multiple design teams, various contractors,  project delivery methods, and inter-dependent milestone/delivery dates added several  layers of complexity.  For example, on the DBOM contract, there were interface requirements between the  guide-way and other construction projects. There were state-of-the-art requirements  for the central control room for train monitoring and control; turn-over requirements to  minimize schedule impacts; unforeseen conditions in excavating, forming, and plac- ing concrete footers for the columns; design requirements for the curved steel beams;  traffic coordination requirements to span a major interstate; coordination requirements  for “around-airport” operations that could not be affected for construction of the CPTC   New RCC Customer Service Center provides efficient, convenient, streamlined service.  (8.3 ATTACHMENT – PAGE 6 OF 12)  SCHEDULE SUCCESSES:   � Construction Notice to Proceed  (NTP) on the RCC was issued  for clearing and grubbing of  the 99-acre Rental Car Center  site on July 5, 2005. Working  in conjunction with the  contractor, we started weekly  progress meeting to assess  schedule, budget and scope on  the site grading project.   � Concurrent with the site work,  the CM@R contractor was  developing his initial GMP for  the RCC which included two  off-site stations – Gateway  and CPTC. Due to interface  concerns, the Gateway and  CPTC stations were removed  from the CM@R contractor and  given to the DBOM contractor.  Less scope and an aggressive  approach to construction  progress and quality helped  greatly in achieving substantial  completion of the RCC 63 days  ahead of schedule.    PROGRAM MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT AT TAMPA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (SOLICITATION #: 13-411-021)  8.3 Respondent’s Experience in Work of Comparable   Scope and Complexity  Section 8.3 – Page 11  Station and the building of the guide-way over airport roads; as well as several others.  All of these requirements were met with close coordination and deliberate planning by  the contractor, our Team, and the Owner. All were achieved with minimal disruption  and issues.  INNOVATION AND CREATIVITY: RCC: To track the thousands of RFIs, submittals and other documents associated with  each individual component of the RCC project, we required the CM@R contractor and  all project team members to use Expedition (Contract Manager). One year into the  contract, we transitioned from Expedition to the web-based Contract Manager, which  allowed our Team, the designers, Owner, and the contractor to access real time data  on the project.  With a common scheduling database, we were able to provide in-depth project sched- ule analysis. The Primavera project schedule was updated daily, and the contractor  provided a weekly update for our review prior to the weekly progress meetings. The  ability to closely examine the scheduling logic of the weekly look-ahead, as well as  the overall project schedule, enabled our project Team to anticipate potential problems  with the CM@R project and other ongoing component projects.  APM: As with the RCC, the move to a web-based project management system  (Expedition to Contract Manager) and the use of a common scheduling database made  coordination on this project much more efficient. In addition, the DBOM contrac- tor employed several visual aids to demonstrate the flow of the guide-way and train  systems using Autocad.  DELIVERING CUSTOMER SERVICE EXCELLENCE: The General Manager’s goal for the ConRAC was to provide airport users with a  pleasant experience that reflects the services of a “Best in Class” airport. In addition  to providing a central location for all rental car services, the APM system provides an  environmentallyfriendly solution to pollution and traffic bottlenecks caused by numer- ous buses circulating the airport.  To meet this goal, the Owner selected our Team to successfully deliver components  that comprised the overall ConRAC Program. Our role was to develop and implement a  team approach to delivering ConRAC components on-time and within budget and meet  or exceed quality expectations.  The continuous oversight our Team provided across the multiple project components,  as well as the activities described below, were keys to success in the delivery of the  ConRAC program.  Our high level of customer service was a direct result of:   » Our inspectors moved from project site to project site as needed to convey critical  information to key field individuals as appropriate.   » Our Management Team always maintained a highlevel overview of project issues  and how they interrelated across the projects, and could convey those concerns to  the Owner for needed action.  (8.3 ATTACHMENT – PAGE 7 OF 12)  COST MANAGMENT   SUCCESSES:   � Excellent cost control on  the CM@R project by the  contractor and our Team  resulted in a savings of $30M  to the Owner despite cost  projections which increased  from DDs to CDs due to price  increases in steel, cement,  and fuel. The designer was  able to focus on the interface  requirements at the RCC  station and the guide-way  and ultimately come in under  budget.

(8.3 ATTACHMENT – PAGE 8 OF 12)  CLAIMS RESULTS:   � There were no claims on the  RCC or APM projects. We were  able to resolve all potential  contract changes quickly,  professionally, and pro- actively through events such  as weekly progress meeting,  partnering sessions, interface  meetings between the CM@R  and the DBOM contractor, and  Executive meetings.

Staffing and technical sup- port needs will be identified by working closely with you  to determine the most cost effective approach for bringing  the requisite expertise necessary for each project phase.  Develop Scopes-of-Work Critical to staffing budget control is development of a  clearly defined scope. We will meet with the Authority  to define a clear understanding of the expectations and  parameters of each project the PMC is engaged on. Todd  McClendon will have full authority and responsibility for  managing the PMC resources and services provided to  TPA. He will work together with the Authority to analyze  each project from the perspective of what skills and exper- tise would be needed to effectively augment the capabili- ties resident at TPA.   Todd functioned in a similar capacity at ATL where project  management services were integrated with the Depart- ment of Aviation in a highly collaborative and interactive  environment directly supporting the airports’ management  staff. Todd will engage with the Authority along with Jeff  Weiner, Design Quality Assurance Manager, and John  Cordner, Construction Quality Assurance Manager, to ana- lyze each project relative to anticipated services required  for design phase activities as well as construction and  activation/commissioning phase activities and define the  staffing that would be expected for the TPA projects.   Jeff and John worked in similar capacity at the ATL project  along with Todd, which involved a considerable number  of staff resources from the ATL Department of Aviation as  well as consultant support, all of which were coordinated  and monitored by Jacobs to maintain strict control over all  resource utilization and provide for seamless and efficient  utilization of contract labor. Jeff and John each provide  more than 30 years of experience in design and construc- tion of airport facilities and infrastructure and have a  wealth of knowledge regarding the level of effort involved  with program planning & support, project phasing, manag- ing design progress, conducting design reviews including  constructability reviews and value engineering, providing  appropriate cost estimating at specific milestone deliver-  ables and other design phase services, and construction  management and contract administration activities. Their  experience will provide TPA with confidence and  reassurance that scopes are well defined and reflect  the level of experience and specialization required to  provide comprehensive, yet cost effective, manage- ment coverage.  Establish and Manage Staffing Budgets With clearly defined scope and consensus with the Authority  we will collaborate with you to develop a staffing strategy  that effectively provides TPA with all resources and techni- cal expertise necessary to execute the project(s). We will  be conscious of in-house capabilities and develop a staff  augmentation approach that maximizes TPA capabilities  and augments the resident staff with expertise necessary to  deliver all required tasks and activities. The best practices  we have developed through successfully delivering over  $100B worth of airport projects combined with our past  experience with the design/build teams selected to-date  (e.g. Austin Commercial at ATL, DFW, PHX, and Skanska at  IAH, GSP, BOS) will allow us to provide you with insight and  strategic staffing recommendations for the composition and  quantity of technical and managerial expertise necessary to  effectively manage project execution.   Once staffing requirements are determined we will utilize  the full depth of aviation expertise available within Jacobs  and our principal sub-consultant AECOM to identify the  best resources appropriate for integration with the TPA  team. Staffing projects will be facilitated by a carefully  managed on-boarding process under the responsibility of  our Project Manager with support from AECOM and their  extensive knowledge and familiarity with TPA. This will  provide the Authority with an efficient and cost effective  process for augmenting in-house capabilities and main- taining a seamless management effort for oversight and  coordination of all airport projects. All PMC resources and  services outlined for support by Jacobs will be identi- fied with labor hours and rates according to established  discipline classification as approved by the Authority.  We will utilize a work breakdown structure to provide for  management of all PMC labor similar to how we manage  other consultant services. We recognize that under a staff  augmentation contract format the PMC costs must be  carefully monitored and managed with the same level of  integrity and intensity as those of all other contractors  and consultants on the project. As such we will work with  the Authority to establish a budget structure that provides   8.5 COST CONTROL (LIMIT THREE PAGES) – PAGE 1 OF 3  Describe how the Respondent will monitor and control staffing budgets for the projects to which they are assigned.    PROGRAM MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT AT TAMPA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (SOLICITATION #: 13-411-021)  8.5 Cost Control Section 8.5 – Page 2  8.5 COST CONTROL (CONTINUED) – PAGE 2 OF 3  for clear delineation of project services and utilization of  technical resources that can be integrated with the current  platform preferred by the Authority for consultant contract  management.  Monitoring Schedule Progress Once staffing budgets are developed in accordance with  clearly defined scope(s) of service, the management  and control of the budgets will be performed by our Key  Personnel in conjunction with the Authority management  staff. Monitoring and controlling staffing budgets is directly  related to the accuracy and validity of the project schedule  as it is essential to correlate staffing resources and level  of effort to project progress and timing of deliverables (see  “Graphic 8.5-1: Sample Staffing Schedule” above). We will  also provide comprehensive, realistic project schedules  and a consolidated master schedule that will be integrated  with the staffing budget to provide the means to carefully  monitor and manage our PMC staffing budgets.    As depicted in the “Controlling Staffing Budgets” graphic  above the success of effective management and control  of consultant budgets is a multi-step process that must  be clearly established and carefully monitored throughout  the project delivery continuum. We also recognize that  providing timely and accurate budget status updates and  information is critical to the Authority’s goal for maintain- ing control of all costs and expenditures at the airport.  Because of the considerable experience we’ve had in a  staff augmentation role embedded within our client’s own   management team we have developed highly effective  processes for maintaining a consistent staff budget control  system that can facilitate regular monitoring and reporting  of all PMC labor in a seamless and transparent fashion. We  believe this is critical to establishing and maintaining the  level of confidence and trust amongst all parties involved  with the delivery of the capital projects included with this  scope.   Our Project Controls Manager, Peter Elgohary, will be  responsible for the budget management process and  developing reporting protocols that are consistent with  the expectations of the Authority and adapted as neces- sary for the projects included with the PMC scope. Peter  provided this service in the exact same capacity for nine  years as a senior manager for Continental Airlines/United  Airlines, where he was responsible for all project cost and  schedule control activities for the $150M Terminal B South  Concourse redevelopment projects at Bush Intercontinental  Airport Houston (IAH), and the $75M Terminal C renova- tions, where the contractor was Skanska (as highlighted  in the Skanska proposal for the TPA Main Terminal &  Airport Concession Redevelopment Program). The suc- cess of those projects was facilitated in large measure  by the collaboration and trust developed between Owner/ User groups and contractor for developing and maintaining  accurate and reliable cost and schedule information neces- sary to make budget decisions in a timely fashion.  Delivering Predictable Outcomes As PMC Jacobs will bring our vast experience from  previous airport expansion and renovation projects to  the TPA program to deliver predicable outcomes for all  programming, concept development, planning, design  and construction budgeting – all in a verifiable, transpar- ent system. We have developed industry best practices  for managing staff resources and budgets and delivering  successful results with similarly complex projects and  programs at airports across the country. Our program  management teams use processes and best practices   Graphic 8.5-1: Sample Staffing Schdule    PROGRAM MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT AT TAMPA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (SOLICITATION #: 13-411-021)  8.5 Cost Control Section 8.5 – Page 3  8.5 COST CONTROL (LIMIT THREE PAGES) – PAGE 3 OF 3  known as Jacobs Value Enhancing Practices (JVEPs –   best practices) and our ‘Value Plus®’ process for deliver- ing cost effective management services to our clients  which have often yielded cost savings or cost avoidance  equal to and/or exceeding the cost of our services. Overall,  we have 22 such documented practices. What differenti- ates our process from others is the rigor and discipline  applied to identifying and anticipating risks and deploying  proven mitigation strategies. When applied to a capital  program such as that at TPA our JVEPs have a proven  history of delivering owners a predictable outcome to each  component of their Program. Using the Value Plus process  in FY2013, we provided $4.2B of documented project sav- ings to our clients which came from 3,890 ideas gener- ated from 1,037 projects worldwide. Specific examples of   our successes in delivering value to other airport clients  through proven cost and schedule management techniques  are shown in the table below.  With proven experience and understanding of managing  our services with the same discipline and control that we  apply to all consultants and contractors we will provide  the Authority with the confidence and competence to  control our PMC staffing budgets and deliver cost effec- tive solutions at TPA to successfully deliver the airport  Master Plan while maintaining full airport operations and  avoiding impact to the wonderful customer experience  that is TPA. u   Project Construction  Value  Value to Client (Cost/ Schedule)  Cost Management Startegies  Project Definition and Programming:  DFW Int’l Airport, Capital Investment Program, DFW Airport, TX  $2.2B $3.9M (life cycle cost) Performed a Total Cost of Ownership Study versus a First Cost  Analysis.

CAPACITY TO PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL STAFF   Introduction Jacobs together with our principal sub-consultants,  AECOM and PGAL, will provide unsurpassed airport experi- ence and capacity to the Hillsborough County Aviation  Authority (Authority) in support of your Master Plan expan- sion. Our three firms, and the specific Key Personnel we  are proposing, represent highly regarded aviation industry  leaders who have significant credentials and experience in  collaborative program management and staff augmenta- tion on similar complex capital improvement programs.  Collectively, we bring to this opportunity the capacity of  over 1.500 airport professionals with experience in every  facet of airport planning, design, construction, activation,  and operation and demonstrated performance to deliver  outstanding facilities and successful project execution  while performing as augmented staff.   is consistently ranked as one of the  top aviation firms in the country (by Engineering News- Record) and is considered one of the nation’s leading  providers of comprehensive aviation services. Since 1958,  Jacobs has managed, planned, designed, permitted, and  constructed more than 1,200 airport related facilities  throughout the country.   We have held contracts at more than 80 airports, includ- ing 12 recent Airport programs totaling $15B in construc- tion value. Recent similar airport staff augmentation and  construction management support has been provided at 9  of the nations’ busiest airports, including:   » Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International (ATL)  » Los Angeles International (LAX)  » Dallas/Ft. Worth International (DFW)  » Phoenix Sky Harbor International (PHX)     For the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX)  Capital Improvement Program, we value engineered  their new parking structure design, resulting in the City  realizing a $5M cost savings by identifying and recom- mending cost effective, robust and environmentally  sustainable alternatives to traditional materials.      With access to our deep collective of airport expertise and  professional resources, together with our local staff of  over 400 professionals in our three offices in Tampa and  an additional nine offices within the State of Florida, we  provide the depth and breadth of experience necessary  to support all staff augmentation needs at TPA in a most  efficient, cost effective manner.    has been a leader in the aviation  industry for over 60 years and has been the #1 ranked firm  in the business for the past six years (Engineering News- Record). Based in Tampa, the AECOM aviation practice  has over 1,000 aviation professionals engaged on airport     PROGRAM MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT AT TAMPA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (SOLICITATION #: 13-411-021)  8.6 Approach to the Assignment Section 8.6 – Page 2  8.6 APPROACH TO THE ASSIGNMENT (CONTINUED) – PAGE 2 OF 10  projects across the country and the world. They are a  leading global provider of technical and support services  to airport owners, investors and aviation clients, with over  $75B in completed airport projects and 25M sf of built  terminals. Recent similar aviation program management  contracts include:   » San Diego International (SAN)  » Chicago O’Hare (ORD)  » Washington Reagan National & Dulles (DCA & IAD)   » Ft. Lauderdale-Hollywood International (FLL)  » George Bush Houston (IAH)  In addition to these noteworthy projects AECOM was also  the designer of record for the award winning ConRAC facil- ity at FLL, a 4.4M SF, $210M facility which was managed  by our proposed Project Manager Todd McClendon on  behalf of the airport.  is a recognized leader in the aviation industry,  with a portfolio of project services encompassing over  $5B worth of design and management of airport improve- ment projects across the country. Of particular note is their  dominant position in the industry with respect to ConRAC  facilities, where they have programmed, planned, designed  and managed construction of more ConRACs than any firm  in the world. Their familiarity with all of the national rental  car agencies from this vast experience and the trust that  has been developed by and with the RAC industry will be  of tremendous value to the Authority for the design and  construction of the TPA ConRAC facility. Recent similar  aviation projects include:   » ATL ConRAC and APM system (managed by Jacobs &  AECOM)   » Philadelphia International (PHL) New International  Terminal (managed by AECOM)   » Reagan Washington National (DCA) new terminal,  parking structures, bridges, and Metro station  (managed by AECOM)   » George Bush Intercontinental(IAH) Terminal B  replacement concourse & Terminal E Concessions  Program (designed with Jacobs)  Much of the com- bined airport expe- rience of Jacobs,  AECOM, and PGAL  has been gained  through similar pro- gram management  staff augmentation  contracts, which  demands greater  capabilities for  integrating techni- cal competence with  interpersonal skills  and emphasis on  collaboration and  teamwork. Recent   collaboration between our firms at the nation’s two larg- est airports (ATL and ORD) demonstrates the capacity  and capability for successful project delivery that we can  provide together.  At ATL, Jacobs, AECOM and PGAL were integrated with  the Department of Aviation to manage the design and  construction of the largest ConRAC and APM system in  the country (built by Austin). In Chicago, Jacobs worked  together with AECOM on the design and construction of  Runway 10C-28C and associated Taxiways.   We assembled this team in order to combine the best,  most respected professionals in the aviation business  together with a deep bench of resources and expertise  in the full spectrum of airport facility planning, design,  construction and operations. Our team’s portfolio includes  extensive program and project experience in all compo- nents of airport facilities included with the TPA Master  Plan.  Specific to ConRACs and APMs, in addition to PGAL’s  extensive portfolio, AECOM has delivered ConRACs at  SAN, ORD, ATL, FLL, RSW, and YEG, and APMs at ORD,  IAD, ATL, and SMF. Similarly, Jacobs has extensive experi- ence in the delivery of the full range of airport facilities and  infrastructure included with this scope as demonstrated in  Table 8.6-1 on the next page.  From commercial hub airports (ATL) to small commercial/ general aviation (Jacksonville Herlong Recreational Airport)  we focus on relationship building with each client airports’  staff and establishing credibility with the stakeholders we  serve.

We’ll be best positioned to capital- ize on our knowledge of each of these consultants and  contractors to apply lessons learned and develop optimal  solutions to the design and construction challenges in a  proactive, efficient manner. Our previous working experi- ence with your consultants will also afford them with the  added confidence and assurance of the capabilities and  motives associated with the Authority’s management team  and thus maximize your investment in the overall effective- ness of the entire team.  Supporting Resources In addition to the Key Personnel identified above, our team  provides tremendous capacity and proficiencies for sup- porting the Authority in any and all necessary functions  and technical expertise required to support the projects  anticipated at TPA. We recognize that your project needs  will fluctuate over the course of the program – you do not  want to wait for PMC support nor do you want unneces- sary or underutilized consultants billing their time. Our  tremendous capacity and approach for augmenting your  staff will ensure that the required resources with the requi- site expertise and knowledge together with a collaborative  behavior will be available in the most effective, economical  manner possible.  Together with our principal sub-consultants AECOM and  PGAL, we have over 1,500 aviation professionals with  experience in airport planning, design, and construction  that represent a tremendous resource pool available to the  Authority as needed. We bring experience with current,  leading-edge, innovative expertise encompassing the full  spectrum of services included with this scope (PMC RFP  Sec 3.1) as illustrated in Table 8.6-3 on the next page.  Of particular note is the vast experience we bring to the  Authority to provide the risk management skills outlined in  Section 3.1.5. Managing multiple projects in an operating  airport environment brings challenges and complications  that must be addressed in a pro-active, dynamic manner.  Maintaining operations in a safe and efficient manner is of  paramount importance to the success of this program. Our  process for mitigating risk is fundamental to our project  management philosophy and capitalizes on the lessons  learned and best practices that we have developed from  the many other airport projects we support.  Jacobs and AECOM together presently have development  programs occurring at over 25 major North American  airports where we are engaged in delivering program  management services for airport improvement. Weekly, we  bring our program managers together through a confer- ence call where we discuss project issues, advances,  trends and needs; lessons learned; construction issues;  and staffing conditions for those programs. This call is  referred to as our Program Management Forum (PMF). It  is a means of connecting our program managers and thus  our clients and their programs to share experiences that  will benefit those programs. This proactive approach to  sharing lessons learned and dealing with risks on projects  and programs affords our clients the breadth and collec- tive experiences of Jacobs and AECOM and brings cost  benefits in solving project issues. The PMF also affords our  clients a means of quickly benchmarking their programs  and approach with their airport peers. This PMF is a no  cost, value-added benefit that will significantly enhance  the confidence and trust in successful project delivery at  TPA.  Included with our proposed Key Personnel are the follow- ing highly regarded aviation professionals as part of our  support staff and technical subject-matter-experts:   » David Grauvogl, PE – 30+ years’ experience with  multi-project aviation capital programs, with expertise  in construction and program management, field  engineering/inspection, scheduling, claims and change  order negotiations.

Mr. Grauvogl can assist during  pre-construction efforts, assistance with design/build  contract matters, and provide insight into construction  claims.    » Denise Burleson – 30+ years of experience in  transportation engineering and project management  of large, public capital improvement programs.  She is highly experienced in working with APM  projects, and has provided support for major APM  projects such as the ATL ConRAC APM. Ms. Burleson  will provide APM and railway expertise to the  program, including preliminary design verification  analyses, value engineering support, procurement  specification preparation, bid evaluation, review of  the design/builder’s schedule, field verifications, and  commissioning.

Jacobs’ corporate  philosophy includes not just partnership with these firms,  but also empowerment, continual development and assis- tance of the W/MBE staff, and opportunities to facilitate  steady growth throughout the relationship. We seek out W/ MBE partners to develop long-term business relationships  and to provide opportunity, guidance, mentorship, and  training to enhance their company growth goals and objec- tives.

We understand the considerable  value and benefit that is derived from having a thriving  business community with a range of firms engaged in  delivering professional services.   Our approach to achieving these accomplishments starts  with both the investment of significant time and effort to  understand the availability, needs and capabilities of each  W/MBE firm, and researching how they will best fit into  the program requirements to achieve the highest level of   participation. We will work with the Authority to identify  the most efficient, cost effective strategy for engaging our  W/MBE sub-consultants with well-defined scopes-of-work  and opportunities for contributions in meaningful ways.   We have consistently provided great opportunities for  the local W/MBE community in delivering professional  services, and have routinely met and exceeded W/MBE  goals for program management services. Examples of our  experience providing opportunities to W/MBE firms and  exceeding percentage goals include the following:  Project Program Goal Actual Exceeded by  Atlanta Int’l Airport Capital Development Program  40% 42.37% 2.37%  Detroit Int’l Airport Captial Improvement Program  30% 31% 1.00%  St. Louis Int’l Airport Develop- ment Program  30% 37% 7.00  Denver Int’l Airport Concourse  C East Expansion  20% 27% 7.00%  DFW Int’l Airport Design Manage- ment Terminal A &C Re-gating  35% 45.12% 10.12%  Chicago Department of Aviation  On-Call Task Order Contract  30% 43% 13.00%  New Orleans Airport Taxiway G 31.22% 5.38%  In addition we were cited for our success in generating and  managing a highly effective W/MBE utilization effort at LAX  where we have been engaged providing similar services for  many years:      “I would like to congratulate Jacobs for fantastically  proposing 27% MBE/WBE participation and for stepping  up to the plate and making a big effort to do that and  meet their goals”   – Commissioner Velasco (Quote from Los Angeles World  Airports at the BOAC on October 15, 2012)  Our commitment to the W/MBE community extends beyond  simply meeting percentage goals. Jacobs has dedicated  senior leadership for overseeing and developing creative  strategies for maximizing return and investment with the  utilization of W/MBE firms.    VP of Business Diversity, Gabriele  Mack, is an active member of the  Airport Minority Advisory Council  (AMAC) Board of Directors where  she chairs the Government Affairs  Committee.

Commitment to DBE Involvement   In addition, through our Mentor-Protégé Program, we seek  out and engage W/MBE firms who are interested in devel- oping a partnership with Jacobs, where we provide busi- ness guidance to assist in strengthening and expanding  their capabilities, enhancing their technical expertise, and  promoting their competitive growth. In return they provide  Jacobs with additional insight into local market dynamics,  enhanced understanding of the minority community needs  and expectations, and access to the talent pool within the  community through on-the-ground networking.
