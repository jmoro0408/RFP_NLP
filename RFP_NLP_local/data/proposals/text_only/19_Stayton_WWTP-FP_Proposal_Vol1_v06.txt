Wastewater Master Plan Update and an Inflow and Infiltration Study and Mitigation Plan  6  3. Project Scope and Understanding  Statement of Understanding The City of Stayton, Oregon (City) owns and operates  a Class III Wastewater Treatment Facility, Outfall to the  Santiam River, and a Sanitary Sewer Collection System  serving approximately 10,700 people in the City and  in the City of Sublimity, Oregon. A Wastewater Master  Plan was last updated in 2006 which included a Capital  Improvement Program for investing in treatment and  collection system infrastructure through the year 2025.  The City is now seeking an engineering consultant  to update the Master Plan and Capital Improvement  Program through 2040. Key elements of the Project  include: • Updates to population, flow, and load projections using   an approximate growth rate of 1% annually. • Review of regulatory requirements and future   permitting. • Understanding of specific system response to rainfall   derived infiltration and inflow (I&I) and associated  impacts on wet weather capacity of both the collection  and treatment systems.  • Updates to collection system modeling to identify  existing and future system hydraulic deficiencies,  assess system response to I&I, and to evaluate gravity  and pumping capacity improvements.  • Evaluation of target I&I reduction rates, timing,  methodology, and location for cost effective capital  investment.  • Updates to treatment system process and hydraulic  modeling to reflect system operations.  • Assessment of reliable improvement alternatives for  optimal treatment plant performance including wet  weather equalization storage, liquids processing, and  biosolids processing.   • Review of treatment plant and outfall infrastructure  condition, operations, and vulnerability.   • Development of a system-wide cost-effective Capital  Improvement Program including an implementation  and phasing strategy.  • Financial analysis to determine how to pay for capital  expenditures through utility rates and SDCs.  • Plan approval by the Oregon Department of  Environmental Quality.  • Facilitation for technical and citizen advisory  committee meetings, public meetings, and plan  adoption.  Jacobs has a strong understanding in all elements of  the Project, and strong knowledge of the plant through  the recent process modeling efforts and team member  Mark Walter’s recent management role at the plant. The  combination of our familiarity, expertise in treatment,  conveyance, and I&I reduction will provide the City with  a holistic and cost-effective plan that maximizes existing  resources and balances treatment upgrades with  conveyance and wet weather flow reduction.   Task A: Project Management  Craig Massie has been delivering solutions to complex  wastewater challenges for 34 years and is one of  Jacobs’ most respected project managers. Craig’s  project management approach includes the following: • Working with the client and DEQ to establish clear   objectives from the Project kick-off. • Maintaining forward progress by providing a clear   vision of the Project tasks.  • Regular communication with City Project Manager   to avoid surprises and to facilitate critical decisions  including monthly review of Project scope, schedule,  and budget.  • Weekly communication with internal Jacobs team and  subconsultants to coordinate efficient delivery.  • Engagement with senior technical staff during key  phases of the Project for quality review of alternatives,  technologies, and work products.  • Facilitation in workshops, advisory meetings, public  meetings, and DEQ coordination.  Quality Control – Key senior technologists have  been identified to aid in developing and screening  improvement alternatives at the early stages of the  Project. These technologists are experts at identifying  cost effective and reliable treatment and conveyance  improvement solutions. The senior technologists will also  serve as reviewers for workshop materials and master  plan documentation.  Sequencing, Approach, and Work Plan Our work plan including task sequencing for the  Wastewater Master Plan Update is illustrated in Exhibit  3. The work approach includes efficiency measures for  parallel work in the collection and treatment systems  early in the Project. In the later stages of the Project,  system-wide alternatives will be considered to capture  cost-effectiveness across treatment, conveyance, and  I&I reduction. The approach includes early coordination  with DEQ to identify opportunities to reduce effort  in areas that are less critical to agency approval.  A key part of the work plan includes sequencing  engineering analysis and field investigation with  three key workshops. Each workshop will allow the  City to engage on key decisions for refinement of the  Wastewater Capital Improvement Program (CIP), project  prioritization, and implementation strategies. The specific  work elements and areas of focus are further outlined  below. Task A-1: Kick-off – The City and Jacobs team with  discuss and identify Project goals and objectives,  highlight Project success factors and risks, review  schedule, define communication protocols, and initiate a  data request. Task C: Preliminary Engineering and Field Work  – Jacobs will review data from the City and perform  parallel analysis in the treatment and collection systems.

Work Plan and Sequencing, Including City Involvement    Wastewater Master Plan Update and an Inflow and Infiltration Study and Mitigation Plan  8  Desktop analysis will consist of model refinements and  calibration (treatment and collection system), population  projections, flow and load projections, existing and future  capacity assessments, and conceptual improvement  alternative development. Field work and City staff  interviews will be conducted to develop condition  assessments, outfall assessments, O&M strategies,  vulnerability assessment at the treatment plant, and  redundancy assessment at the treatment plant and City  lift stations.  For the treatment plant, critical capacity bottlenecks will  be evaluated and summarized. Preliminary alternatives  will be developed including opportunities to convert the  un-used selector cell facility to improve equalization  ahead of disinfection. Planned capital projects,  such as a third SBR, will be reviewed for necessity  and timing relative to revised flow/load projections.  Process modeling and analysis in conjunction with  close coordination with plant staff ideas, and potential  opportunities to expand the plant footprint with the  purchase of adjacent property that may become  available will allow a broad evolution of bio-solids  optimization. Jacobs’ recent work on the process model  will create efficiencies for the treatment capacity and  process evaluation.  Simultaneous work will be performed at the treatment  plant to evaluate condition and operations (Task C-1).  Mark Walter’s (WaterDude Solutions) estimates a  50-percent efficiency in completing this task based  on his recent work at the treatment plant. Jacobs will  work closely with Mark to consider the overlap of asset  condition, operation, and replacement with critical  capacity and process upgrades.  In the collection system (Task C-2), the hydraulic model  will be calibrated utilizing available flow metering data  collected by ADS Environmental during a 4-month flow  monitoring period. Previous model calibrations utilized  daily data, which may result in over or under-estimation  of peak flow response. The model calibration will focus  on dynamic simulations for evaluating instantaneous  peak flows. Additionally, Jacobs’ will review DEQ  regulations regarding design storm and discuss level  of service with City staff to determine an adequate  level of risk for planning infrastructure relative to capital  investment. The calibrated hydraulic model will be  used to identify existing and future system deficiencies  and preliminary improvement alternatives. Jacobs’  will work with City staff to understand operational and  capacity limitations including opportunities for lift station  operational changes or decommissioning.  In addition to the model calibration, the flow monitoring  data collected by ADS Environmental will be used to  characterize I&I influence and variability in wet weather  response throughout the City (Task C-3). Jacobs will  work with City staff to identify strategic locations for  meter placement. If a storm event greater than the  2-year frequency occurs early in the four-month flow  monitoring period, ADS Environmental will shift meters  to alternate sites to collect additional data. The data  will be used to quantify I&I rates (peak gallons per acre   per day) in each meter basin. A threshold rate will be  established for consideration of I&I reduction techniques  in each metered basin. Several rehabilitation techniques  will be considered including varied reduction levels and  costs (least reduction/low cost – main pipe lining only;  moderate reduction/moderate cost – main pipe lining  and partial lateral replacement; high reduction/high  cost – main pipe lining and full lateral replacement).  The reduction levels and costs for rehabilitation will  be considered as part of system-wide improvement  alternatives in later stages of the Project.  Flow metering and collection system modeling will be  used to characterize peak flow influence from the City  of Sublimity service area and relative cost contribution  to capital investment for both the collection and  treatment systems. The Sublimity I&I contributions will  be compared to Stayton meter basin contributions to  identify whether Sublimity falls above or below the I&I  reduction threshold. This information will be used to  summarize strategies on coordinating with Sublimity for  cost-effective capital investment including investment in  an I&I reduction program. Workshop #1 – Jacobs will present preliminary  findings related to treatment capacity, conveyance  capacity, and I&I reduction opportunities to City staff.  An overview will be provided of the condition and  operational assessments, vulnerability assessment,  outfall assessment, and redundancy assessment. The  workshop will focus on screening and refinement of  preliminary improvement concepts. Additional Engineering – Jacobs will perform analysis  and cost estimates to refine improvement alternatives  based on feedback in Workshop #1. System-wide cost  effectiveness will be considered to balance treatment,  conveyance, and I&I reduction. Critical phasing and  implementation of projects will be considered relative to  capital investment over the 20-year planning horizon. Workshop #2 – Jacobs will present findings from the  system-wide cost-effectiveness evaluation and provide  recommendations on capital projects. Jacobs will  help the City to rank and select preferred alternatives  for implementation. Project prioritization and phasing  relative to capital investment will be a key consideration  for project selection. Final Engineering – Jacobs will refine projects  prioritization, phasing, and implementation strategies  based on feedback from the City during Workshop #2.  Draft plan sections will be documented and provided to  City staff for review. Workshop #3 – Jacobs will present the draft Capital  Improvement Project list, priorities, costs, and  implementation strategy to City staff for review.  Documentation and Financial Analysis (Task C-4) –  Jacobs will work with Deb Galardi to provide capital  costs and timing of capital projects for the financial  analysis. Within the framework of Oregon law, agencies  have latitude in selecting specific methodological  approaches related to the calculation and assessment     Wastewater Master Plan Update and an Inflow and Infiltration Study and Mitigation Plan  9  of SDCs. The first set of options relates to the overall  structure of the SDC – whether the fees are based  on existing facility costs (reimbursement fee), future  planned improvements (improvement fee), or a  combination. Once a determination has been made as  to the fee structure, the methodology may be further  refined based on a number of additional considerations,  including existing system valuation approach (in the  case of a reimbursement fee), improvement allocation  approach, and fee assessment units (e.g., equivalent  dwelling units and meter size). Deb will work with the  City to evaluate the existing methodology approaches  and determine whether any modifications are needed  to reflect current system capacity conditions and  growth costs. The fees for different types and sizes of  development will be determined based on projected  claims on system capacity. Finally, Deb will estimate  SDC statute compliance costs and develop the updated  SDC schedule. Jacobs will refine the Master Plan document sections  based on City review comments and compile a full draft  Master Plan document for City, DEQ, and public review. Financial Analysis Meeting – Deb Galardi will  present the results of the financial analysis and SDC  methodology to the City. Plan Adoption (Task D) – Jacobs will coordinate  with City staff for three Public review meetings, Public  comment, and DEQ comment. Jacobs will finalize the  Master Plan document based on final City input and  associated comments from the Plan Adoption process. The Role of City Personnel on the Project - City staff  will engage in the project by providing information during  early data requests, participating in project workshops  including decisions on improvement selection, reviewing  Master Plan draft documentation, and participation in  public, advisory, and coordination meetings. Specific City  staff contributions and time estimates are provided in  Exhibit 3. Technical and Citizen Advisory (Task B) - As shown in  Exhibit 3 and the Project Schedule (Exhibit 4), we have  identified timing of up to four insert Technical Advisory   Committee (TAC)/Citizen Advisory Committee (CAC)  advisory meetings. We propose holding these meetings  after the kick-off meeting, and shortly after each of the  three key workshops. The intent of these meetings is to  educate key stakeholders and community members of  potential economic, social, and environmental impacts  of the wastewater collection and treatment systems, and  to implement community feedback into capital program  development.   4. Project Schedule  Our proposed schedule (Exhibit 4) presents a realistic  work plan that will enable City and operations staff to  plan for participation in the process while still being able  to keep up with their other responsibilities.

Wastewater Master Plan Update and an Inflow and Infiltration Study and Mitigation Plan  14  C. References  Ashland Wastewater Treatment Plant Facility Assessment  Date Completed: August 2019 (on time) Cost: $130,000, completed under budget Staff Involved: Craig Massie, Bill Leaf, Mark Walter, Matt Noesen, David Wilson, Tom Jones Owner Information and Contact:   City of Ashland, Public Works; Chance Metcalf, Engineering Project Manager; (541) 552-2448;   chance.metcalf@ashland.or.us  In 2019, Jacobs provided an assessment of the Ashland WWTP to help the City evaluate  the current applicability of improvements suggested in their 2014 Ashland WWTP Facility  Plan (by others). The project included an assessment of the wastewater treatment process  and major process component elements, and an update to flow and load projections  using the past 5 years plant data, capacity and redundancy requirements, and waste  characteristics. In addition, a complete plant condition assessment was performed (by  team member and subconsultant Waterdude Solutions) that statused the condition and  needed repairs and refurbishment for all the plant assets. Jacobs created a treatment plant   process model to evaluate plant operation at the projected future flow and load conditions. The goal of this project is  to recommend prioritized system improvements to optimize the wastewater treatment process and ensure simplicity  of operation. Jacobs used a whole plant analysis approach will provide the City with the information needed to make  the best investment in plant infrastructure to meet treatment needs. Other tasks include the condition assessment of  the plant infrastructure, evaluation of the specific areas for improvement identified by plant staff, and an assessment  of the plant electrical system for harmonic disruption and options for energy efficiency improvement. The project  identified that improvements identified in the facility plan could be delayed by ten to fifteen years with no loss of  treatment or reliability and suggested prioritized improvements to eliminate current treatment challenges.  Clackamas County WES Collection System Master Plan  Date Completed: 2019 Cost: $1,000,000 completed and under budget  Staff Involved: Shad Roundy, Sven MacAller, Mark Johnson, Dan Buonadonna Owner Information and Contact:   Clackamas County; Jessica Rinner, PE, Civil Engineering Supervisor; (503) 742-4551; jrinner@clackamas.us • Model for conveyance, storage, and treatment • Tools for tracking I&I flow reduction • Pipeline and pump station condition assessment • Growth and phasing evaluation • Capacity and condition assessments  • Improvement alternatives for gravity sewers and pump stations • Cost sharing for I&I reduction implementation with member   communities Jacobs completed a comprehensive Collection System Master  Plan for Clackamas County WES. The project included capacity  and condition assessments for thirteen trunk sewers, nine regional  pump stations, and two intertie pump stations which control flow  between two treatment facilities. Jacobs team members developed  an approach to evaluate cost effectiveness of reducing impacts from I&I. The approach compared system-wide  capital and O&M costs for conveyance, treatment, storage, and flow reduction. Statistical analysis and condition  data were used to evaluate system risk and infrastructure degradation. Nineteen sub-basins were targeted for I&I  reduction by 2040 for system-wide cost-effectiveness. Capacity and condition improvement alternatives were further  optimized considering pipeline routing, project phasing, and pump station operations. WES is currently using the plan  to implement a $100 million capital improvement program in the conveyance system including a wet weather flow  reduction program.
