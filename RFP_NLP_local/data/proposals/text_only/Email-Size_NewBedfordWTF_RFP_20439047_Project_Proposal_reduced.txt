Jacobs brings the breadth of our proven, 
full-spectrum resources to offer the 
City of New Bedford the best value in 
integrated operations and a path to 
implementation for realizing the full 
value of its infrastructure investments.

Section 1 – Executive Summary 

The City of New Bedford entered into a public-private partnership for the 
operations and maintenance (O&M) of the wastewater treatment facilities 
in 1993. After more than two decades with a single firm, the City seeks 
competitive proposals from O&M service providers who may offer greater 
value, preserve your capital investment, and assure the long-term reliability 
of your wastewater assets. By engaging Jacobs, a world-class O&M service 
provider and wastewater company, the City can elevate the performance 
of your operations by achieving enhanced reliability in operations, 
maximizing the life of your assets through the deployment of a robust 
asset management program and retaining a highly motivated workforce by 
providing ongoing training and career development opportunities for the 
existing staff. In your next operator, the City is seeking a partner to develop 
specific strategies for the provision of a zero-tolerance approach to odor 
and noise control, asset management, nitrogen reduction control strategy, 
enhanced safety and security, and assurance of environmental compliance. 
These strategies are at the core of Jacobs’ services.
We recognize that making a change may not be an easy decision for the City. 
Some considerations may include the perception of a decrease in service levels 
or impact to existing staff working at the facilities. We thoughtfully address 
these concerns in our proposal and highlight the many benefits our fresh 
perspective and approach delivers to New Bedford and your customers. 
Our diverse team of technical experts has crafted a customized approach 
for progressive O&M strategies and asset management through the 
implementation of industry best practices and new and innovative ways to 
build upon them. Our fresh approach includes solutions and opportunities 
that optimize operations, and when combined with guarantees for improved 
performance of your wastewater treatment facility (WWTF), will bring added 
value with optimized costs. Throughout our proposal we indicate these 
solutions and opportunities with four icons.     



ES-2

Thoughtful Solutions and Investments to Elevate  
New Bedford’s Operations to a Higher Level of Performance
Jacobs proposes creative solutions that address all the keys areas in your request for proposals (RFP) while 
making strategic investments that help elevate the performance of your operations. Following are some of the 
highlights of our offer: 

 y Revamping the project organization with greater emphasis on maintenance of your facilities. 
 y Implementing an industry-leading advanced maintenance management system and asset management program 
that improve performance and reliability while reducing risk, as well as optimizing financial planning and return-on-
investment decision-making. 

 y Conducting a comprehensive odor study to establish the odor control baseline during the first contract year and 
repeating it every five years ($320,000 investment over the 20-year contract life). 

 y Implementing our Pro2D model to ensure reliable biological treatment, biosolids management and effluent disinfection 
while meeting the NPDES permit and Enhanced Limits requirements. 

 y Ammonia Based Aeration Control to reduce power consumption ($3,000,000 savings over the 20-year contract life). 
 y Incentive Savings Program that allows for the recovery of the capital or investment while equitably adjusting the 
ongoing services fee. 

 y Hosting an Annual Innovation Workshop with the project team and other utility experts to focus on continuously 
advancing the City’s operations and avoiding complacency over time ($200,000 investment over the first 20 years). 

 y Implementing a robust Personnel Development Program that includes 2,000 hours of training for startup and 
transition and 1,200 hours per year in each subsequent year. We also plan to raise awareness of environmental career 
opportunities at the WWTP in the community. 

Staff Optimization and Team Organization 
Through a fresh look at the existing organization, we have rearranged our staffing approach to provide 
greater emphasis on proactive maintenance/asset management while focusing the operations staff on 
managing the day-to-day operational activities. This approach allows us to offer a more efficient 
organization while providing a very high level of service through 26 full-time employees (FTEs) under 

the Base Bid and 29 FTEs for Alternatives 2 & 3. We accomplish this efficiency by focusing the resources of the in-house 
laboratory staff to perform daily process and regulatory analysis. We have dedicated one FTE to manage the asset 
management program and oversee the Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS). This individual will track 
the City’s entire asset management, predictive maintenance and corrective maintenance programs, and will work closely 
with the City to plan capital Repair and Replacement (R&R). Furthermore, we are investing in two grinders at the Welby 
and Industrial Park pump stations to allow for more efficient and safer pump station daily checks. Finally, we plan to 
work with the union and negotiate a new 12-hour shift schedule that has proven to be a win-win by both enhancing 
operational efficiency and providing better flexibility to the operators and improved work life balance. 

Comprehensive Asset Management to Extend Facilities’ Value 
Another value-added aspect of our offer is the provision for implementing an industry-leading advanced 
maintenance management and asset management program supported by the revised organization 
discussed earlier. Our vision for the City is to raise the bar in maintenance and asset management best 
practices and significantly improve the performance, reliability and financial decision making while 

reducing risk. Our initial condition assessment in conjunction with the independent third-party audit will serve as a bench 
mark for future capital investment. 
Jacobs’ comprehensive R&R Plan for the City ensures protection of managed assets, system reliability, and proactive 
repair, renewal and replacement planning and financial forecasting. Our R&R program is a risk-based strategy that 

THE CITY OF

New Bedford
MASSACHUSETTS

examines not only the physical condition of an asset 
but also the related health and safety impacts, permit 
and environmental compliance, as well as customer 
confidence and service reliability. Applying the concept 
of relative risk allows for fact-based, repeatable and 
defensible decisions for the maintenance, rehabilitation 
and replacement of infrastructure assets. 

Zero Tolerance Odor and Noise 
Mitigation and Control 

In order to achieve City’s goal of zero 
tolerance odor and noise mitigation 
and control, Jacobs will perform odor 
tests, a $320,000 value over the 

20-year contract life, for the purpose of establishing the odor control baseline during the first contract year and 
reassessing it every five years thereafter. Samples and analysis of the results will then be inputted into our AEROMOD 
gaussian dispersion air model. This optimization analysis will be greatly aided by our WATS collection system odor control 
dynamic computer model. Analysis and subsequent management of these upstream and downstream conditions will 
ensure that odor control operations for New Bedford are fully optimized and that the City’s zero tolerance odor control 
policy will be successfully met. 
The unparalleled acoustics expertise at Jacobs allows us to provide valuable input in every phase of a facility’s life cycle, 
from design to operational maintenance or refurbishment including the evaluation and mitigation of noise related 
issues. For example, a recent project utilized Jacobs’ expertise in Industrial Acoustics using microphones and modeling 
to measure the sound levels of an operational agricultural processing plant and find the primary noise sources. This 
capability can be tapped into should the City desire for greater engagement in this area.

Optimization of Nitrogen Management with Existing Assets while Maintaining 
Environmental Compliance

The most recent NPDES permit, issued in September 2008, requires the City to identify and quantify 
major sources of nitrogen in the influent and develop an approach to optimize plant operation to reduce 
nitrogen discharges in the plant effluent. Jacobs uses software tools, such as our propriety Professional 
Process Design and Dynamics (Pro2D) and Replica, to create digital twins of wastewater treatment 

systems (plant and collection system). These tools allow operators to run what-if scenarios to identify potential impacts 
on the system so they can then prepare and develop contingency plans as needed. The use of the tools also allows 
operators to prepare for potential regulatory changes or wet weather occurrences. Jacobs will use the Pro2D model that 
we have created of the WWTF to optimize the control settings for each unit process to safeguard reliable biological 
treatment, biosolids management and effluent disinfection while meeting the NPDES permit and Enhanced Limits 
requirements. Using Pro2D, our preliminary assessment indicates that we can enhance the BNR process. We plan to 
work with the City and your engineering consultant to further evaluate and implement this improvement opportunity. 

Savings from Enhanced Energy Management that Benefits the City While Improving BNR
Implementing an ammonia-based aeration control to reduce power consumption is another innovation 
that Jacobs has identified. An initial comparison of the observed dissolved oxygen (DO) compared to 
industry standards suggest that the facility is over-aerated. Reducing the DO through tighter logic 
control will result in approximately $150,000 in energy savings annually or $3.0M over the 20-year 

life of the contract, providing that the single-stage blowers can turn-down sufficiently to meet the lower aeration demand.

Incentive Savings Program
Jacobs will work with the City to create an Incentive Savings Program (ISP) that allows for the recovery of 
the capital or investment while equitably adjusting the ongoing services fee. Additionally, through 
Jacobs’ engineering and consultancy services, we offer programs, including modeling and audits, that 
help us identify efficiencies and/or opportunities to lower O&M services. Our ISP allows transparency 
and encourages innovation and enhancement during the life of this contract. 

Enhanced Safety and Security Measures
We have a long history of keeping our employees safe and consistently 
outperform the industry average in safety. Jacobs’ Culture of Caring, 
called BeyondZero™, empowers our employees to create and sustain 
a positive, safe and healthy work environment for themselves and 
colleagues, and extends to the communities we serve. Jacobs will submit 
a Safety and Security Plan within 45 days of the Commencement Date. 
During our site visits, we observed some safety issues that we will resolve as part of the transition activities in the first 
months of operations. For example, we observed numerous guards missing from pumps and motors. 

Personnel Development and Internship
Jacobs’ project training programs are always tailored to specific project needs. We have deployed various 
training systems at more than 200 O&M sites, providing more than 50,000 hours of training to staff 
across North America. A custom training curriculum will be compiled based on everyone’s assessed base 
skills, job descriptions and training requirements outlined in Schedule 10 of the City’s service agreement. 

We have budgeted approximately 2,000 hours of training for startup and transition and 1,200 hours per year in each 
subsequent year. We will provide the City with an annual training report each January, documenting past year’s training 
results and providing a schedule for the upcoming training year. Furthermore, we are committed to hiring one intern 
throughout the year, which will increase awareness in the community to the environmental career opportunities while 
assisting us in recruiting future operators and maintenance staff. 

High Caliber Management and Support Teams Demonstrate Our Commitment to the City 
The success of this partnership hinges on the experience, leadership and commitment of the individuals responsible to 
oversee operations. Our philosophy is to deploy a diverse team of highly skilled and trained employees capable of working 
collaboratively with our clients. For this important partnership, we have handpicked an onsite leadership team made 
up of some of our best and brightest professionals with decades of highly relevant experience. Jacobs is committed to 
maintaining the staffing of the key management roles the City has identified including the Project Manager, Operations 
Manager, Maintenance Manager, and Laboratory Manager. Following is a brief introduction to our leadership team:

Project Manager Michael Arnold is a local, experienced operations manager with over 35 years of plant 
operations experience and established training expertise. He holds a grade 7C wastewater operator and 
grade 4 collection system operator licenses. His experience includes treatment plant operation,

experts to ensure a smooth and efficient transition and optimal operations over the term of the contract.

Seamless Transition Plan Maintains Smooth Operations and Keeps Quality Staff on Board
Jacobs recognizes that the success of this partnership will be defined, in part, by a proven transition process that delivers 
high quality and reliability of services and greater protection of assets. More importantly, we understand that there are 
several good employees currently working at the facility and our goal is to retain as many as possible. Our transition 
approach is highly collaborative to ensure a seamless process that respects everyone involved. 
A smooth transition is one of the first steps in a successful partnership with Jacobs. While the physical process of the 
transition is significantly important, we view this step as more than a transfer of responsibilities from another firm to us. 
Jacobs’ transition is the first step in the transformation of your operations to a high performing utility. As such, we invest 
significantly in the implementation of our systems, tools and processes, coupled by a strong focus on training and the 
development of our culture. 
Furthermore, we have successfully transitioned a number of wastewater projects from your current operator and helped 
the owners improve the performance of their operations. Some of these projects include: Woonsocket, RI (16 MGD - 
2012), Vancouver, WA (44 MGD - 2016), Gresham, OR (20 MGD - 2018), and we have recently been selected for a 20-year 
partnership which we are negotiating now with Wilmington, DE (170 MGD - 2020) - all long-standing Veolia contracts 
spanning up to 38 years in duration (Vancouver). We strongly urge you to contact these clients to learn firsthand their 
experiences in transitioning to Jacobs as their wastewater system operator.

Build on Our Commitment to Serve the New Bedford Community
Jacobs has significant experience already working in the New Bedford region. Through our work with the US Army Corps of 
Engineers, Jacobs is playing a significant role in the clean-up of New Bedford Harbor. We are removing close to one million 
cubic yards of phenanthrene degradation bacteria (PDB) contaminated sediment from the harbor. Our team completed the 
hybrid dredging phase sooner than anticipated, saving one month’s time and nearly $3M in project costs. 
Jacobs is also working for the City’s Planning Department. We recently contracted with the City to provide planning and 
design services for a 1.4-mile segment of the Blue Lane – Working Waterfront Connector, a shared-use path along existing 
heavily used roadway. These two active local projects have yielded invaluable working relationships between Jacobs staff 
and City staff—relationships that will prove beneficial for client coordination and project management.

Proposer’s Performance History 

We are proud of our long-standing history of delivering services in an ethical manner. Our 
industry leadership has consistently been recognized by the Ethisphere Institute naming 
us as one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies for nearly a decade. This award recognizes 
our advancement of best practices in business ethics, compliance practices and corporate 
social responsibility.  

Failure to Complete Work –OMI has not failed to complete any contract or had any contract 
canceled for poor performance or default. Moreover, we have a contract renewal rate of 98% 
since 2013 with our O&M clients.  

Barred from Bidding – Neither OMI nor any affiliate has been barred from bidding on public 
contracts by the federal government or by any governmental entity in Massachusetts or any 
other state. 

Criminal Conduct – OMI and our officers are in good legal standing and have no history of 
charges or convictions for crimes of moral turpitude, such as bribery or fraud, or for any other 
illegality relating to its operations. 

Bankruptcy – Neither OMI nor any affiliate has been the subject of any bankruptcy action. This 
is made evident by our completion of the Proposer Qualifications Form in Section 5 – Proposal 
Forms.  

Violations of Regulations – We have an excellent 
reputation among regulatory agencies, and we are 
committed to full disclosure and the remedying of 
situations that may arise, even when an excursion 
occurs outside of our operational control. Every 
year, our projects comply with thousands of 
permit limits that range from hourly, daily, weekly, 
monthly, and annually. The very low number of 
violations that we experience each year is a very, 
very small fraction of the total number of permit 
limits we are required to meet at all our projects, 

which lends to our 20-year compliance record of 99.98%. We have provided 5-year compliance 
histories for five exemplary projects in Section 2.D – Project Experience. Below are additional 
compliance issues not covered in that section. At no time has Jacobs been fined in these instances.  

In January and June 2015, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality issued a Notice of 
Violation to the City of San Marcos for violations of the Texas Pollution Discharge Elimination 
System permit, attributed to excessive rainfall, which caused hydraulic overloading of the WWTF. 

On May 8, 2018, Jacobs received a Preliminary Assessment Letter dated July 5, 2018 from the U. S. Coast Guard for a release of 3,500 
gallons of 37 percent sodium bisulfite into the Norwalk River over a 30-hour period, beginning on May 8, 2018. The release was caused by a 
bypass valve left in the open position following a line maintenance flushing event. 

For the period between July 2016 and September 2019, the City of Coos Bay, Oregon received a Notice of Violation from the Oregon 
Department of Environmental Quality for permit limit violations for Total Residual Chlorine, Biochemical Oxygen Demand, Total Suspended 
Solids and Sanitary Sewer Overflows.

B. Facility Operations and Performance Standards 
Jacobs Understands the City’s Values and Goals  

The City of New Bedford is seeking competitive proposals that offer greater value, preserve your capital investment and assure the long-term 
reliability of the wastewater assets through enhanced technical reliability and viability, superior asset management and career development 
opportunities for all qualified plant personnel, along with moving forward your vision for the future through engaging with a world-class O&M 
service provider who exemplifies success in elevating treatment facilities’ performance. 

The contemplated scope of services under Alternative I (Base Bid), 2 and 3 supports the City’s vision and encompasses reliable O&M of the 
WWTF. In Alternative 2, the City adds the responsibility for all 29 wastewater pump stations. In Alternative 3, the City reduces the number of 
lift stations to the 12 largest pump stations. Alternatives 2 and 3 also include the operation and maintenance of the WWTF. The City will 
determine whether it will engage the Contract Operator to be responsible for all (Alternate 2), some (Alternate 3) or none (Base Bid) of your 
pumping stations. 

In addition, the City is looking for your new partner to develop specific strategies for the provision of a “zero-tolerance” approach to odor and 
noise control, nitrogen reduction control strategy, enhanced safety and security, assurance of environmental compliance, and the opportunity 
for professional development for the employees. These strategies are at the core of Jacobs services. 

Jacobs has found opportunities for more efficient operations with advancement needs in the areas of energy optimization, 
maintenance, automation, and reporting. The facility is beyond its 20-year-old mark, and this is the opportune time to 
perform a comprehensive asset evaluation and decide on targeted capital investment that will extend the useful life of this 
facility into the next phase. We have put together a value-packed proposal that will deliver innovative and award-winning 

operations with a strong focus on asset and maintenance management to elevate the City’s wastewater program to the next 
level of performance. 

Jacobs Approach to Providing Superior O&M Performance Through a Well-Designed O&M Plan 

Overall Management Philosophy 

Jacobs has learned through decades of experience that our O&M approach must be dynamic to remain relevant to ever-changing needs and 
goals. Developing and implementing comprehensive and thoughtful O&M and related facilities plans establishes the foundation and 
expectations for performance, and they work best when approached as a team that partners together to deliver the best results. The general 
system management philosophy we apply to all the facilities we operate is shown in Exhibit 2.B.1. It is to leverage the full breadth of our 
integrated resources to cost-efficiently deliver the performance excellence our clients like the City expect.  

Management Procedures and Policies 

The cornerstone of our approach to delivering superior high-quality services is recruiting, selecting, training, and retaining well-qualified, 
experienced professional staff. Our personnel will take pride in maintaining the character and standards that protect the residents’ quality of 
life. Jacobs recognizes the commitment required to maintain quality throughout a long-term operations contract. Our approach is to create a 
regular schedule of structured activities that encourage and foster quality. Furthermore, as part of this commitment, our onsite staff, executive 
leadership and City stakeholders will be involved in structured quality verification activities, including: 

 Annual vision, alignment and expectation workshops to strengthen and evolve the partnership 

 Quarterly business reviews of our activities 

 Clear communication protocols 

 Continuous review, evaluation and improvement of performance reporting processes 



 

  2-7 

EXHIBIT 2.B.1. JACOBS’ SYSTEM MANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY LEVERAGES FULL BREADTH OF INTEGRATED RESOURCES 

 

A key component of the quality management program is training focused on continual improvements in customer satisfaction and service 
delivery (e.g., timeliness, completeness, consistency, thoroughness, and responsiveness). 

Jacobs will develop detailed and thoughtful operations plan that sets the foundation and expectations for performance. Plans work best when 
approached as a team working together to deliver the best results. We will work with the City and provide continual and transparent 
communications such that the City will be “up to speed” if an issue arises, so resolutions can be made quickly and without interruption to 
services. Using proven and rock-solid approaches help keep everything running smoothly, combined with an open, collaborative environment. 

By actively applying best management practices and focusing on continuous improvement, Jacobs helps clients achieve and exceed their 
strategic goals. For this important partnership, Jacobs offers quality and reliable wastewater service, regulatory compliance, and innovative 
and cost-effective O&M systems with significant focus on complying both with the NPDES and odor/noise management for the WWTF, and also 
the protection of your assets. We are confident our Operations Plan and overall approach as described in this section and throughout this 
proposal will not only comply with all state and federal regulations, but also help the City maximize the useful life of your system while 
reliably serving your customers. 

Jacobs will apply the state-of-the-art tools summarized in Exhibit 2.B.2 in order to guarantee our performance and to ensure the success of 
this important partnership. Detailed discussion of these tools is provided in Section 6 – Supplemental Information to demonstrate the depth 
of our capabilities and approach to the City’s needs.

Proven O&M 
Plans 

Plan Description Due By Benefit to the City 

Unit Process 
Control 
Procedures 
(UPCPs) 

UPCPs outline our operations road map, establish the key 
performance and parameters we track, drive process adjustments 
we make based on the results, direct continuous improvement, and 
clearly establish communication venues and related control of 
process adjustments. UPCPs also provide a level of detail for 
operators and maintenance personnel to make informed decisions. 

90 days Documented procedures and process targets that 
are shared with the City, management, operators, 
maintenance, and laboratory staff ensures that 
we all have a common purpose and goal. The 
detailed information provided maximizes 
efficiency and minimizes potential for errors and 
downtime. 

Process Control 
Strategy 

The process control strategy takes into account the facility design, 
influent loading, and permit requirements. From that, our 
operators and engineers develop a strategy that will best meet 
those conditions while maintaining efficient operations. 

Jacobs offers the unique ability among other leading O&M service 
provides in our ability to also design in-house completely new 
systems that deliver excellence. The Company-wide Process 
Control System (CPCS) is one of the newest innovative 
developments of Jacobs and far exceeds industry standard 
practices. Jacobs has developed CPCS that makes full use of plant 
data and modeling to take a fully scientific approach to Process 
Control. The core of the CPCS focuses on control and results.  

90 days A comprehensive and thoughtful process control 
strategy is key to providing the focal point for all 
process control activities. 

Jacobs CPCS system utilizes our process model, 
Pro2D, and our O&M capabilities to predict upper 
and lower operating parameters (or limits) for 
each unit process and then this data is utilized by 
the plant operations staff and regional technical 
specialists to assess the data and to make the 
necessary changes to maintain treatment 
performance. 

Sampling Plan The sampling plan includes a well-thought-through and 
understood list of sampling locations, a sampling map, and 
parameters to be sampled at each location. It also identifies 
methods to be used, proper chain of custody techniques, and 
proper preservation procedures. 

30 days A properly written and implemented sample plan 
is critical to the compliant and efficient operation 
of a facility. Reliable, accurate data starts with 
representative sampling to achieve effective 
solids balances and process control. 

Data 
Management 

The data management software (HACH WIMS) is tied to the 
sampling plan. Each sample point has associated parameters that 
are used to track the process directly or through calculations. The 
data for the parameters are based on laboratory analysis or online 
instrumentation and are entered manually or directly from SCADA. 
The database is the foundation for regulatory reporting, process 
control, and standard or custom reports.  

60 days Direct access to the data management software 
will allow the City to “mine” the database for 
specific data, as desired. In addition, periodic 
reports will provide the City with a quick 
summary of how the plants are performing with 
regards to the discharge permits and how the 
individual processes are performing.  

Standard 
Operating 
Procedures 
(SOPs) 

Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are developed to ensure 
that safe work practices and consistent operations of equipment 
and systems are implemented and followed by operations and 
maintenance staff. SOPs typically contain precautionary safety 
steps followed by startup, shutdown and routine monitoring of the 
equipment.  

 Development of SOPs is an ongoing process. 
Critical SOPs will be developed first and as new 
SOPs are required these will subsequently be 
developed by the operations and maintenance 
staff. SOPs will ensure that consistent and 
standard procedures are followed by the staff to 
ensure staff safety, operations performance and 
equipment reliability.

Plan Description Due By Benefit to the City 

Operator Round 
Sheets 

One of the most effective ways to maintain control of the treatment 
process and operational equipment is to perform at least daily 
rounds on the treatment process. Daily round sheets consist of 
readings, observations and preventive maintenance tasks that will 
typically identify potential upsets or problems with equipment 
before anything happens – basically allow the Operator to make 
any necessary process adjustments or create maintenance work 
orders to proactively correct a maintenance item. In addition, 
Operator round sheets identify general housekeeping actions for 
keeping the facility safe and clean for all staff and potential visitors 
to the site. 

 Round sheets are printed out daily through the 
CMMS and completed by the Operator at least 
daily or twice a day, as necessary. Unusual 
observations are document and recorded on the 
round sheet and the data is uploaded into the 
CMMS. In addition, any unusual observations or 
readings are reported immediately to the 
Operations Supervisor so that the appropriate 
action can be taken in a timely manner. 

Sample Tracking 
Tool 

Jacobs has a Sample Tracking Tool that is utilized by plant 
operations and laboratory staff to monitor and track all process 
and regulatory sampling and analytical requirements. This Sample 
Tracking Tool is developed and implemented at the start of each 
year and as samples are taken and analyzed in-house or sent to a 
third-party laboratory, the sample is checked-off by the person 
that has pulled the sample and then is checked-off the same day 
by a second independent party to ensure that all process and 
compliance samples are taken as per the regulatory permit. 

 Jacobs takes seriously the NPDES requirements 
outlined in the City’s discharge permit for the 
wastewater treatment plant. A key element to 
this compliance is ensuring that the samples and 
analyses are performed at the locations and 
frequencies outlined in the permit. It is 
unacceptable for our staff to miss a permit 
compliant and/or test result and the Sample 
Tracking Tool provides the necessary quality 
assurance to ensure that no samples or 
parameters are missed by the project team. 

 

We begin with an understanding of your permit requirements and your objectives as stated in the RFP. We will then develop and document an 
overall operating strategy. The strategy identifies critical aspects of the treatment process, details how unit processes will be monitored and 
controlled, and establishes our strategic and tactical approaches to achieve the treatment goals in the most efficient and reliable manner. 
Operating strategies are updated quarterly based on revised process and electrical models. During each review cycle, we explore opportunities 
for innovation and adjust our operations strategy accordingly. Once a strategy has been established, it is supported by specific documentation. 
Our plans have been developed to avoid process upsets and maintain high-quality, steady-state operations. 

A critical aspect of Jacobs’ holistic approach to process control is holding weekly project coordination meetings with all operations and 
maintenance staff. The purpose is to review performance over the previous week, make process control adjustments, discuss maintenance 
concerns, and plan for upcoming maintenance activities. The results are documented and posted for all staff. We have found that these weekly 
meetings are critical to building our overall O&M team and to improve communication, planning and performance throughout the operations.

Asset Management Approach 

Jacobs’ effective asset management will 
guide the repair and replacement process 
to maximize the City’s return on 

investment. 

Jacobs’ has written the book for effective asset management. 
Literally. Jacobs has partnered with multiple agencies including 
Water Environment Federation, U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency, National Association of Clean Water Agencies, and 
Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies to author several 
asset management guidance documents. Jacobs is a leader in 
asset management best practices and applies our industry best 
practices to every asset management project that we perform.  

Jacobs has been helping customers effectively manage wastewater assets for decades. We 
have continually developed specialized practices to help optimize day-to-day the 
operation, maintenance and capital improvement of our clients’ infrastructure. Specific 
tools including our Asset Condition Assessment Evaluation System (ACES) and Asset 
Replacement Model (ARM) will be customized for the City’s managed assets.  

These tools will be used to manage the wide range of assessment information developed for 
the City, integrate with the Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS), and 
deliver the complex reporting necessary to support the repair and replacement (R&R) 
decision processes. Each process area and location will be assessed for its consequence and 
likelihood of failure resulting in a Risk Score that is specifically developed for the City. This 
is followed by a comprehensive condition assessment where individual assets are assessed 
and also receive a Total Risk Score. The result is a relative Risk profile of unit process areas 
from highest to lowest and a ranking of assets within those areas from highest risk, poorest 
condition to lowest risk, best condition. This Risk profile drives the R&R scheduling and 
planning process.  

Initial Condition Assessment 
Establishes the Baseline  

The condition assessment (CA) process 
used by Jacobs is a core component of 
the rehabilitation and replacement 
planning program. Within the first six 
months of operation, Jacobs will 
perform a condition assessment for 
managed plant and pump station 
assets. This process is continued on 
an annual basis for required high risk 
assets with a three-year maximum 
inspection interval for all managed 
assets.  

The basis for assessing the condition of assets is the development of a set of asset-specific 
questions that focus on the visual and measurable indicators of an asset’s condition. To 
accomplish this, a registry of the assets to be assessed is reviewed and arranged into asset-
type classifications.  



 

  2-11 

The next step is to apply assessment criteria or a set of questions and answers that spans the range of likely conditions that may be 
observed or measured to effect remaining useful life. (See Exhibit 2.B.3 for an example.) For each condition assessment criteria 
question that is developed for an asset a score of 1 to 5 is assigned to each answer. The answers are arranged so the best condition is 
given a score of 1, and the worst condition is given a score of 5. The number of answers to each question varies depending on the 
granularity of the inspection. Therefore, some questions will simply be YES (1) or No (5) questions, while others may have five separate 
answers with scores ranging from 1 to 5. By rolling up the scores of each question for an asset, an overall score for the asset is 
calculated. Since not all questions may be as significant an indicator of the condition of an asset, questions may also be weighted. For 
example, where applicable, Infrared Thermography Tests, Volt-Amperage Balance, and Motor Insulation Resistance are considered 
major factors for asset Physical Condition in this assessment and carry a heavier weight than other assessment questions for the 
particular asset class. Also, Performs Intended Function is used to determine whether an asset is operating in the capacity that was 
originally intended regardless of condition. 

EXHIBIT 2.B.3. JACOBS USES MOBILE ASSESSMENT FORMS WITH THE ABILITY TO ATTACH PHOTOGRAPHS TO DEVELOP ASSESSMENT SCORES 

 

Elevating Levels of Performance – Going Beyond with a Risk Assessment Approach 

Risk can be defined as the potential for realization of unwanted, adverse consequences to organizational and service delivery 
strategies. While the current condition of an asset is widely accepted as the primary indicator of its likelihood of failing, 
there are additional risk factors specific to the City’s wastewater facilities that can more accurately help define the optimal 
rehabilitation or replacement strategy and timeline. These specific risk factors, like adherence to O&M procedures and 

performance, will be used to create a managed asset risk profile that is relative to the needs of the City’s assets. Applying the concept of 
relative risk allows for fact-based, repeatable and defensible decisions for the maintenance, rehabilitation and replacement of 
infrastructure assets. This defines the risk-based assessment, which leads to development of a more comprehensive asset replacement 
methodology and schedule.  



 

  2-12 

In the context of utility asset management, the focus is on the risk of asset failure, where failure is not only the physical breakdown of an asset, 
but the inability of an asset to meet its intended purpose. The risk of an asset failure is quantified as a function of the consequence of the asset 
failure and the likelihood that the asset will fail, as shown by the risk equation: Risk = Consequence x Likelihood 

Consequence of Failure: The consequence of an asset failure focuses on the impact a failure may have on a process area or lift station’s ability 
to meet its established level of service targets. The consequences of an asset failing are usually static, unless there is a change to an asset 
required level of service, permit, regulation or there is a redesign of the facility. The static nature of the consequence of failure also makes the 
consequence score for a process or asset a potential way of assigning criticality or priority to the assets.  

The Consequence of Failure matrix criteria (Exhibit 2.B.4) that will be developed for the City’s Managed Assets establishes levels of service 
categories and the range of consequences, negligible to severe, with applicable scoring. Each category is weighted in terms of its relevance to 
the City operational goals and shows as a percentage out of one hundred in the table. Consequence of Failure is calculated as a sum of the 
products scored.  

EXHIBIT 2.B.4. CONSEQUENCE AND LIKELIHOOD TABLES WITH RISK SCORING THAT IS SPECIFIC TO THE CITY’S MANAGED ASSETS 

 

Likelihood of Failure: Similar matrix criteria will be developed and weighted for the City scoring the Likelihood of Failure (LoF). Each 
likelihood category is assigned a weighted value based on its contribution to the overall likelihood of an asset failing to meet its 
intended purpose over a range of likelihood (negligible to very likely) with scores (1-10). Since the current physical condition of an asset 
is considered to be the leading factor in predicting the likelihood that an asset will fail, the Physical Condition carries the highest 
weighting. O&M protocols, the documented procedures the station is operated by and historical reliability receive a lower weight. 
The likelihood of an asset failing is the most common factor in changing the total risk an asset poses to the operation. While 
changing the consequence of a failure usually requires a process or permit change, likelihood is dynamic and will change more 
frequently based on operation and maintenance of the asset. Each LoF category is weighted in terms of its relevance and is shows as a 
percentage out of 100 in the table.

Estimated Remaining Life Determination 

Based on information from the International Infrastructure Management Manual, the condition rating of an asset can be used to make 
assumptions about the immediate maintenance needs of the assets and to calculate the remaining useful life as described in Exhibit 2.B.5

3 Indicates that the asset is in fair condition. The asset has one or more issues that require immediate attention. The 
current maintenance and operating procedures or intervals may need to be modified or adjusted to avoid 
recurrence of identified issues. 

50% 

4 Indicates that the asset is in poor condition. Planning for a major overhaul or replacement should begin. Review of 
current maintenance practices and procedures is recommended. If this is a critical asset, a predictive maintenance 
program should be evaluated to prevent the asset from reaching this condition in the future. 

30% 

5 Indicates that the asset is in very poor condition. Failure of the asset is imminent or has already occurred. Greater 
than 50% of the asset requires replacement. If this is a critical asset, a comprehensive maintenance program 
should be evaluated to prevent the asset from reaching this condition in the future. 

10% or less 

 

Jacobs developed the ARM to 
conduct capital replacement 
prioritization and planning and to 
determine an overall asset 
replacement schedule. Using 
comprehensive input from the 
condition and risk assessment 
process, ARM can generate 
triggers that signal rehabilitation 
and replacement decision points, 

as shown in Exhibit 2.B.6. These triggers produce a prioritized list of assets for R&R 
consideration that are further reviewed for the planning and scheduling. The ARM 
process creates an objective, repeatable process for developing the R&R schedule. 

Features of the ARM tool include: 

 Identifies R&R triggers based on actual asset condition, annual maintenance 
costs, and remaining useful life 

 Includes replacement asset value so a preliminary prioritized R&R plan may 
be developed 

 Able to use existing condition assessment information as a starting point 

 Highlights troubled assets and discovers proactive maintenance optimization 
opportunities through the condition assessment process 

 Identifies candidate assets for further net present value analysis to determine 
action on high-risk or costly asset replacements 

 

Through the Asset 
Replacement Model (ARM), 
Jacobs will develop a 
comprehensive, annual 
rehabilitation and replacement 
for managed assets.

approach provides the City consistency, transparency, proven tools, and resources that will deliver superior protection of your assets. Our 
proven program will ultimately result in a financially efficient system with better planning capabilities and reduced financial and 
environmental risk.  

As part of our commitment to the success of this project, we will 
implement our proven, advanced asset management program, 
coupled with industry best maintenance management practices 
with highly trained managers, to maximize the life of existing 
assets and ensure that new assets meet or exceed expected service 
lives. Exhibit 2.B.7 depicts our implementation approach to 
developing the comprehensive asset management program for the 
City’s wastewater managed assets. 

The benefits derived from a well-organized and well-delivered asset 
management and maintenance program include improved 
performance and reliability, extended equipment service life, 
reduced maintenance costs, more efficient use of labor, improved 
aesthetics of the site, reduced environmental risks, improved long-
term planning, and improved workforce morale. We will keep the 
City’s assets in a proper state of repair, addressing items in a 
proactive rather than reactive manner. To do this, we employ proven 
preventive maintenance (PM), reliability centered maintenance, and 
predictive maintenance (PdM) programs managed through the 
CMMS.

Condition-Based Maintenance 

An important enhancement to our maintenance strategy is the 
introduction of condition-based maintenance practices (Exhibit 2.B.8). 
Most asset maintenance and replacement strategies are based on age-
related failures and rely on simple time-based methods for defining PM 
intervals or replacement, even though only a minority of failures are time 
related. Current asset failure models demonstrate a nearly 90% degree of 
randomness, rendering simple, time-based strategies inadequate. The 
best mitigation against random failure is to monitor the condition of 
the assets through non-destructive testing such as ultrasonic, 
vibration, oil, and infrared imaging analysis. Jacobs uses all these 
technologies to monitor the condition of critical assets, mitigating the 
risk of random failures that can occur at any time of an asset’s life.  

Condition-based 
maintenance is a key 
step in the cycle of 
maintenance 
management and 
provides the data 
necessary to make 
efficient decisions about work priorities, repair and replacement needs, and capital 
planning. Given the importance of this step, and how often we conduct condition 
assessments nationally, we have developed efficient and award-winning techniques that 
translate to better data and less cost through targeted maintenance expenditures. While 
condition-based maintenance decision making is industry best practice, the default 
approach using a time schedule (monthly, quarterly, annual, etc.) for several classes of 
critical equipment has value, especially for recently replaced or renovated assets. Most 
equipment manufacturers still base their warranty agreements on meeting time-based 
PM tasks, therefore, we consider both schemes when making decisions on the 
frequency and nature of proactive maintenance work. 

 

EXHIBIT 2.B.8. JACOBS’ CONDITION-BASED MAINTENANCE 
(CBM) PRACTICES INCREASE SYSTEM RELIABILITY 

 



 

  2-16 

As part of a company-wide initiative that began in 
2016, we carefully studied the maintenance 
practices at dozens of the treatment plants we 
operate, and then developed our corporate 
maintenance standards around an industry best 
practice model to address the gaps identified. We 
now use the Uptime Elements model for our 
maintenance program and have reinvented the 
company standards accordingly with the 
publication of our Maintenance Resources Guide 
for plant staff to follow 

A key finding of this initiative was that most of our 
equipment failures were the result of just a 
handful of factors: equipment alignment, 
lubrication, and CMMS data management gaps. 
As a direct result of this, we now actively 
promote maintenance skills training with 
approximately 300 hours per year of local, 
hands-on, in person instruction for vibration 
analysis, alignment, oil analysis, CMMS 
software, ultrasound and troubleshooting, 
taught by our own regional maintenance 
experts in each subject area. 

Routine Preventive, Corrective and Predictive 
Maintenance 

Routine Maintenance (RM) 

RM is the first line of defense and provides many benefits to the overall maintenance management plan. RM is performed by staff members 
who operate the processes and equipment daily as they make rounds during their assigned shifts. They visit and observe each process and 
equipment area to inspect equipment condition and performance using a “stop, look, and listen” approach, which in many cases can provide 
early detection of potential failures or malfunctions.  

Preventive Maintenance (PM) 

PM is repetitive activity required or recommended by the equipment manufacturer or industry best practices performed to optimize the service 
life of the equipment, vehicle, facility, or other asset. Proper PM is a critical line of defense against equipment deterioration and failure, and 
includes activities specified by the manufacturers’ maintenance recommendations as outlined in the vendors’ O&M manuals; these may be 
superseded by client-accepted practices established though the Asset Management process. Work orders generated by the CMMS outline the 
required PM; upon completion of a work order, the following information is logged in the CMMS: 

 Work order issue date 

 Completion date 

 Staff performing the task 

 Description of all tasks completed 

 Labor hours and estimated labor cost 

 Materials quantity and cost 

 

Jacobs’ approach to maintenance skills training and predictive 
maintenance techniques improve uptime and reduce 
corrective maintenance. 



 

  2-17 

EXHIBIT 2.B.9. PM PLAN FOR SINGLE ASSET EXAMPLE 

 

We have an established PM approach that includes a list of specific activities to be performed for the various components of infrastructure (i.e., 
assets) that comprise the facilities, as well as the recommended frequency of performance. Exhibit 2.B.9 is an example of a preventive 
management plan for a single asset. 

Asset task descriptions include the manufacturers’ recommended procedures and their corresponding appropriate interval for the 
maintenance activities to be performed. The recommended intervals for task performance are evaluated for PM optimization, and validated 
through our asset management program, which analyzes the following criteria:  

 Condition-based information from non-destructive testing 

 Manufacturers’ O&M manual recommendations for specialized equipment and equipment under warranty 

 Age, condition, and function of the equipment 

 Risk and consequence of failure 

 Severity of service and rate of wear and corrosion 

 Cost of maintenance as compared to replacement cost, if failure does not risk the safety of personnel or create a process upset 

Our CMMS provides asset registry, maintenance scheduling, documentation, tracking, and equipment condition history into a computerized 
database that enables Jacobs to maximize equipment performance and minimize downtime. Jacobs utilizes Maintenance Connection® (MC) 
as our computerized maintenance management system (CMMS), with cloud-based reporting for enterprise level metrics analysis. Using a 
centralized CMMS provides several quality tools that, when used effectively, facilitate better decision making, such as determining whether it is 
more cost effective to replace an older asset based on maintenance costs versus replacement costs. 

Corrective Maintenance and Root Cause Analysis 

Equipment does not last forever, but it is valuable to understand why a failure occurs, especially if it is unexpected, and to predict failure 
modes on critical systems. Jacobs’ O&M group boasts several Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM2) certified practitioners with the 
knowledge and experience to perform a thorough analysis of potential failure modes at the site, using SAE JA1011 standards. These 
practitioners share their knowledge and experience through our communities of practice similar to other Jacobs experts and technologists and 
are included and available on demand to assist the on-site team when issues arise. The analysis looks at the ways assets and systems can fail, 
the causes and results, and preventive measures to mitigate the associated risks.  

Sometimes these failures can be very hidden indeed, as was the case with a simple 2-inch sample tap in a concrete vault that our team 
identified on a massive transmission line for the Central Arizona Project - an unmanaged failure could have jeopardized water delivery to 
millions of customers. 

Root cause analysis of maintenance failures is addressed in two ways: for major failures, it follows a prescribed process that may involve a 
team of engineers and maintenance experts to determine causes, both “root” and “contributing”. 



 

  2-18 

Failures of non-critical assets still receive attention, but with a less formal “5 Why’s” 
approach (Exhibit 2.B.10), like how we conduct safety incident investigations. For every 
“explanation” of a failure, we ask why again. After the fifth “why”, the root cause is 
typically discovered. Jacobs works to minimize maintenance and repair expenses and 
focuses on investments in the facilities that provide the greatest potential for avoiding 
costly repairs and service interruptions. 

The benefits derived from Jacobs’ well-organized and well delivered asset management 
and maintenance program include improved performance and reliability, extended 
equipment service life, reduced maintenance costs, more efficient use of labor, reduced 
environmental risks, improved long-term planning, and improved workforce morale. Our 
fully developed asset management program will keep the City’s Managed Assets in a 
proper state of repair, addressing items in a proactive rather than reactive manner 

Predictive Maintenance (PdM) 

Predictive Maintenance (PdM) techniques are designed to help determine the condition of 
in-service equipment in order to predict when maintenance should be performed. A key 
component of our preventive maintenance plan and asset management approach, PdM tasks 
are assigned to all major electrical and mechanical equipment. They are routinely tested to confirm all components are in good working order and 
verify that no negative trends exist that reduce the equipment’s overall life expectancy and integrity. All data collected during testing will be 
collected and entered into CMMS and ACES databases so that trends can be easily identified. In consideration of the City’s managed assets, the 
Jacobs onsite staff will be trained in specific testing procedures and have access to specialized equipment for PdM analysis.  

Several PdM testing procedures are employed by Jacobs: 

 Major power distribution components and the motor control centers (MCCs): infrared (IR) inspections are a very simple, non-destructive 
method of identifying anomalies that could lead to potential failures. 

 Main pumping equipment: we perform routine vibration analysis and trend the data to provide for early detection of worsening 
conditions. Vibration analysis is used and trended to provide additional performance information, including optimum bearing life. 

 Ultrasonic meters are used for precision bearing lubrication, first to determine the need for lubrication, then to apply the correct amount 
of lubrication to ensure the bearing is operating at peak efficiency. Ultrasonic testing is also done on all electrical panels and MCC’s to 
determine the presence of loose connections or electrical faults. 

 Large electrical motors: vibration testing, oil analysis, and temperature monitoring are components of our PdM program for large 
motors. All data is trended to provide early detection of potential problems. 

 Emergency generators: in addition to our onsite staff maintenance, we use outside contractors who are experts in generator O&M. This 
PdM program includes many testing procedures, such as oil analysis, vibration monitoring, temperature monitoring, and IR inspections. 

 Miscellaneous major equipment: to supplement our onsite PdM program we will use outside contractors with specialized skills to inspect 
and monitor major equipment condition. This will include HVAC systems, specific large air compressors, cranes, and other unique 
equipment types. 

Inspection Procedures 

Equipment and process inspection are the cornerstone of proactive maintenance and operation practices. An experienced operator or 
mechanic’s senses can detect issues with both process and mechanical systems. Jacobs transcends the traditional five senses by augmenting 
staff experience with several technological methods designed to offer diagnostic precision for faults and defects. 

An example of enhanced operator round effectiveness is the use of ultrasonic detection equipment to determine bearing lubrication 
intervals/repair of costly air leaks and/or an infrared meter for detection of loose electrical connections in a motor control center. Each of 
these items would generate costly repairs if left to the limitation of the five senses. By the time an operator or mechanic can detect a defect (in 
the yellow zone shown in Exhibit 2.B.11), significant damage has manifested in the component. Predictive maintenance technologies identify

APPROACH TO ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS  
 



 

  2-19 

defects at the earliest stage and offer a 
medium for monitoring and trending the 
defect. The repair can be made at the 
optimum time for process continuity, safety, 
and preservation of critical asset 
components.  

Equipment inspections are organized through 
Maintenance Connection, our computerized 
maintenance management system (CMMS). 
Many inspections are determined by 
manufacturer’s recommendations. These 
include weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-
annual and annual intervals. Jacobs employs 
progressive maintenance philosophies to 
determine the best interval for optimum 
asset life. The administration of dozens of 
preventive, predictive and corrective work 
orders across thousands of assets is a 

daunting task that is met through planning and scheduling, augmented by CMMS and combinatorial optimization. 

Jacobs utilizes proprietary PM optimization analysis software designed to eliminate wasteful PM work orders or activities within existing work 
orders that don’t add value to asset preservation. Failure modes and effect analysis (FMEA) provides empirical data points for optimizing PM 
activities to reduce known failure modes. Maintenance Connection also has programming that optimizes intervals to reduce trips to pump 
stations, locations and individual assets. The overarching goal is to visit the assets when required yet with the minimum number of visits to a 
specific location or asset. 

Combinatorial optimization is utilized in route optimization strategies. The permit requirements and operations standards outlined in 
Appendix 3 and Massachusetts regulations dictate specific intervals for maintenance activities. Pump stations will be visited every day. Our 
route optimization techniques organize the work in such a manner that the required number of visits for each station is programmed to 
meet the requirement and reduce the amount of travel and increase efficiency. It is nearly impossible to manually improve on 
combinatorial optimization. Jacobs uses these advanced technologies to strategically allocate resource to the greatest benefit of the 
organization. The result is more time spent on maintenance and reduced waste from duplicative activities. 

Maintenance Recordkeeping Process 

Jacobs uses a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) at all of our projects to manage assets. Our project standard CMMS is 
MC, however, we have experience with all leading CMMS products including Lucity. Our CMMS provides asset registry, maintenance 
scheduling, documentation, tracking, and equipment condition history into a computerized database that enables Jacobs to maximize 
equipment performance and minimize downtime. Using a centralized CMMS, such as MC, provides several quality tools that, when used 
effectively, facilitate better decision making, such as determining whether it is more cost effective to replace an older asset based on 
maintenance costs versus replacement costs.  

Jacobs will transfer the available historical maintenance data from the City and input these values into MC. We will work with the existing 
contractor to extract database files for integration into MC to preserve asset history. Our technical team will enhance this information by 
conducting a condition assessment on all critical assets in the City’s system. A condition assessment will guide initial maintenance efforts and 
identify any issues that require immediate attention 

EXHIBIT 2.B.11. EARLY DETECTION ENSURES REPAIRS ARE MADE AT THE OPTIMUM 
TIME 

 



 

  2-20 

The work order includes the asset requiring service, the type of work order, e.g., corrective, emergency, preventive, etc., and the resources 
assigned to the task. Depending on the complexity of the repair, the work order may list several mechanics and a large collection of parts and 
tools. The planner/scheduler uses the work order system to assemble maintenance staff and the necessary parts for execution of the task. The 
number of hours spent performing the work, parts, sublets and any other costs are included in the work order. Each work order is finished the 
day the work is completed. The Maintenance Manager is responsible for validation and closing each work order. Accurate and careful recording 
of work order activities helps the project to conduct valuable analytical 
processes such as Failure Modes and Effect Analysis (FMEA). An FMEA helps 
define defect modes and provides valuable insights into eliminating defects 
and improving plant reliability.  

Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) 

Jacobs CMMS system offers a complete platform for managing the City’s 
assets. The CMMS is a cloud-based system available on any internet capable 
Windows based device, including smart phones and tablets. The initial screen 
(Exhibit 2.B.12) offers the key elements of the platform.  

Sample Outputs 

The most used choice is the Maintenance, Repair & Operations Work Center, the 
nerve center of the CMMS. The first screen (Exhibit 2.B.13) gives an overview of 
maintenance activities with tabs to drill into the details of the program.  

EXHIBIT 2.B.13. MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES OVERVIEW SCREENSHOT FROM JACOBS CMMS 

 

 

The Asset Registry contains all assets, organized by process. The registry contains all the critical information for each asset, including model 
number and serial number. Additional tabs are available to show asset history, PM maintenance, meter readings, costs, insurance and 
customizable fields to meet the requirements of the City’s operational interests.  

Maintenance activities are recorded on the asset with hours of effort and any additional costs.  

Monitoring Measures 

Effective monitoring is the collection of actionable data designed to improve the overall reliability and performance of the asset. Predictive 
maintenance technologies are appropriate for monitoring equipment condition and health. These technologies include vibration analysis, 
ultrasound analysis, oil analysis, infrared analysis and motor current analysis. Each of these disciplines offers a medium for trending 

EXHIBIT 2.B.12. INITIAL SCREEN OF JACOBS CMMS 



 

  2-21 

equipment condition over varying time intervals. As the criticality of the equipment increases, the frequency of monitoring and recording the 
condition of the asset or components increases. Highly critical equipment may be candidates for continuous monitoring. 

Monitoring involves collection of information through one or more of the predictive maintenance technologies, recording the information, 
evaluating data trends, and taking action based on the incremental degradation of the asset or replaceable components. All assets have a 
degradation curve. The goal of effective monitoring strategies is to provide corrective maintenance at the point of the degradation curve that 
produces the greatest value to the organization in reduced costs and downtime. 

 

Jacobs’ approach to this important partnership considers total maintenance costs, asset condition, and 
estimated remaining life when making R&R decisions for facility assets. The benefits of our well-
organized and integrated approach—which includes a comprehensive R&R Plan—yields improved 
performance and reliability, extended equipment service life, reduced maintenance and capital costs, 
more efficient use of labor, and reduced environmental risk for the City – we are committed to 
improving the condition of your facilities.  
 

Overall Approach to Performing Repair and Replacement 

With the last major upgrade occurring in the early 1990s Jacobs realizes the impact of assets nearing their original design life. Jacobs’ 
comprehensive Repair and Replacement (R&R) Plan is driven by our industry leading Asset Management Program approach which ensures 
protection of managed assets, system reliability and proactive repair, renewal, and replacement planning and financial forecasting. Jacobs’ 
R&R program is a risk-based strategy that examines not only the physical condition of an asset but also the related health and safety impacts, 
permit and environmental compliance as well as customer confidence and service reliability for the City and your constituents.  

R&R Quality Control Process 

Jacobs is committed to ensuring that the health of the City’ managed assets is consistently maintained throughout the term of this 
partnership. Through regularly scheduled condition assessment, for all managed assets, R&R planning priorities are reviewed at regular 
quarterly intervals as well as after any safety, permit or compliance incidences. The review team includes local project staff in collaboration 
with regional O&M specialists, regional business manager and Jacobs engineering office team members. These important responsibilities are 
continually reviewed by our business risk assessment team as part of Jacobs’ corporate oversight. Jacobs will always provide technically 
sound, cost effective, sustainable R&R solutions that take into account the mission and goals of the City and maximize return on investment.  

Jacobs’ Unique Capabilities Assist with Optimal Operations 

Jacobs offers a unique set of capabilities in modeling, process design, and operations that gives us a keen understanding 
of the wastewater treatment plant, in particular the operation of the Primary/Secondary treatment systems, which is 
critical to ensuring that treatment is stable and at optimal performance to meet the regulatory requirements and to 
comply with the NPDES permit. A similar approach will be used for biosolids operations and to support the transition of 

biosolids treatment of from thickened sludge and to dewatered solids. 

This collaborative combination of operations, maintenance, and process expertise will focus on optimally controlling the amount of solids 
within the aeration basins in order to achieve the CBOD and TSS solids reduction while maximizing nitrogen removal within the process units. 
By using our modeling tools and expertise, Jacobs can optimize the control settings for each of the unit processes to ensure reliable biological 
treatment, biosolids management, and effluent disinfection. Just as important, these models will manage and track various process 
parameters such as mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS), mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) and dissolved oxygen (DO) levels 
throughout the activated sludge system; solids retention time (SRT), return activated sludge (RAS) rates and waste activated sludge (WAS) 
rates for maintaining the proper level of MLSS/MLVSS within system so that the secondary effluent CBOD, TSS and nitrogen levels entering 
the final stage of treatment—the chlorination and de-chlorination processes—meet the NPDES permit and Enhanced Limits requirements. 

Routine monitoring and laboratory analysis are key elements for ensuring continuous and reliable treatment performance. Activated sludge 
systems are proven and reliable treatment processes, but as with any system, if the treatment process gets out of balance a possible plant 
upset may occur. Thus, the continuous monitoring of process parameters both upstream, midstream and downstream of the treatment 
processes is very important in providing timely information to operations on the condition and status of the treatment processes. 



 

  2-22 

In addition to the NPDES permit monitoring requirements, frequent monitoring of the primary influent and effluent TSS, sludge pumping rates 
and sludge blanket levels will be used to ensure that influent solids are being rapidly removed providing high removal rates to minimize solids 
carry over to the activated sludge system.  

For biological treatment, the operation of the activated sludge system and secondary clarifiers will require monitoring of the influent and 
effluent quality of these treatment processes to ensure CBOD removal, nitrification/denitrification for nitrogen reduction and additional TSS 
removal prior to disinfection. For the secondary treatment processes, both hydraulic and solids loading rates will be monitored to avoid 
overloading. In addition, oxygen levels throughout the secondary treatment processes will be monitored and controlled to ensure that 
adequate dissolved oxygen is provided to achieve CBOD removal and nitrogen reduction.  

Biological process models will be used to evaluate the whole treatment system for optimization opportunities. Jacobs will 
use our propriety Professional Process Design and Dynamics (Pro2D) to create a model of the New Bedford Wastewater 
Facility. We can simulate influent loadings and process changes to understand the impacts on treatment performance. 

Overall, Pro2D will be used to enhance the operation of the treatment system as a whole. In addition, our Pro2D model will be 
utilized for analyzing and optimizing the control setpoints for energy and chemical addition.  

In addition, the process model allows operations staff to evaluate potential strategies for process optimization due to changing conditions in 
the influent flow and/or loads, to maximize chemical additions for odor control both within the collection system and the wastewater 
treatment plant, and to maximize chemical addition for the chlorination and dichlorination processes to ensure adequate disinfection is 
achieved prior to dichlorination. 

 

Finally, the whole plant design of the process model will allow for evaluation and optimization of the solids residuals treatment system. 
Whether providing solids treatment for sludge thickening or sludge dewatering, the Pro2D model can support operations in the better 
management and control of the chemical feed systems in order to ensure a minimum of 86% thickened sludge is achieved. 

We discuss how we will establish plan optimization of nitrogen removal in Section 2.F – Environmental Protection and Mitigation. 

Jacobs’ Ability to Conduct Evaluations and Implement Improvements 

We also have unique tools that combine sophisticated process modeling, detailed O&M pricing, and 40 years of inhouse operations data from 
hundreds of wastewater treatment plants to benchmark performance. This is a far more precise and credible set of tools than relying on 
textbook values alone. 



 

  2-23 

Jacobs uses industry standard process models developed to design and optimize WWTFs. Jacobs’ Professional Process 
Design and Dynamics (Pro2D) is one of the tools that will be used for energy auditing and process optimization. 

Based on industry leading models for WWTFs—such as the International Water Association’s Activated Sludge Model (ASM) 
2D model for activated sludge, Pro2D tracks several wastewater process parameters from raw water influent quality, unit 

process influent and effluent parameters, and activated sludge conditions using kinetic and stoichiometric information within 
historical data ranges. Our team will be able to produce a comprehensive mass balance over the entire wastewater treatment plant, including 
plant recycles, which allows us to predict the impacts of changes made to the plant in terms of both effluent quality and solids handling 
requirements.  

Pro2D offers several benefits, particularly speed and ease of use. When calculating capacities at WWTFs, it allows engineers to complete 
roughly a week’s worth of hand calculations in less than two hours. Using Pro2D, our engineers have developed preliminary process models for 
the wastewater treatment plant based on the existing operation conditions. The models can be further adjusted to evaluate the biological 
treatment and unit process options possible to achieve optimum process performance with the goals to reduce energy consumption (which 
reduces the cost to the City) and general operating costs within the plant’s process areas including biosolids treatment and chlorination/de-
chlorination. These adjustments will be carried out without compromising current effluent quality and quantity as well as solids production.  

Operating Protocols / Unit Process Control Procedures 

Our operational strategy will be based on New Bedford’s permit requirements, influent characteristics, plant configuration, and existing 
operations data. Building on this information, we will develop unit process control procedures (UPCPs) for each of the unit processes (I.e., 
preliminary treatment, primary treatment, secondary treatment, chlorination/de-chlorination, biosolids thickening and biosolids 
dewatering) to achieve our treatment objects and to meet all regulatory and enhanced treatment requirements. An additional key element 
to the overall operations of the treatment plant is our Operations Strategy which incorporates all elements of the project from how sewage 
is managed coming into the treatment plant through the treatment process until final disposal (effluent discharge via the outfall and 
biosolids disposal by the City). 

Process Control Monitoring 

Most of what is accomplished in a WWTF is not readily visible. We must understand the status of treatment processes through the collection 
and analysis of data to optimize treatment. Jacobs understands that the operations team must carefully design a process monitoring plan to 
“see” the status of each treatment process. Further, the integrity of that data must be protected through each stage of collection, transport, 
storage, and analysis for resulting data to truly represent the condition of the processes.  

Our process monitoring plan will include parameters to be analyzed, sampling frequencies, and locations. We include a location map of all 
permit and process sampling locations, type, and frequency of the sample. After we assume operations and begin to make process 
adjustments, firming up a functional operational strategy and establishing a steady state operation will be our primary focus. 
Subsequently, this plan will be reviewed as process changes dictate to ensure we are collecting the samples needed to fully visualize the 
status of treatment processes. All operations staff are trained on this plan at least annually or when there are changes and are involved in 
the review process. 



 

  2-24 

Process Control Tools 

Process Control Tools (Exhibit 2.B.14) are the mechanism for applying 
science to the task of controlling treatment processes. Examples include 
SRT, food to mass ration (f/m), and other calculations. These tools consist 
mostly of calculations set up in the operational data management software 
called Hach WIMS.  

Perhaps one of the most important distinctions of Jacobs is the unique ability 
to design completely new systems that deliver excellence. Jacobs’ Company-
wide Process Control System (CPCS), developed with HachWIMS, is one of 
the newest innovative developments of Jacobs and far exceeds industry 
standard practices. We have developed CPCS that makes full use of plant data 
and modeling in a fully scientific approach to Process Control. The core of the 
CPCS focuses on control and results. For each step of a treatment process 
operating parameters, control points and results are determined.  

In 2019, Jacobs completed a comprehensive plan to 
revolutionize the optimization of plants and monitor site 
specific conditions in a meaningful way. New Key 
Performance Indicators (KPIs) were designed to surpass 

the metrics used in the past. The KPIs in this new system 
measure the performance of operators in terms of how well they achieve the 
targets for each parameter that they can control. The KPIs are set up in a 
grading system (A-F) that is simple to understand and easily recognizable.  

Our CPCS system begins by using our process modeling (Pro2D) and 
engineering capabilities to predict the upper and lower bounds of proper 
operating targets. These are used as the starting point, and over time we add multivariate analysis using site specific data to verify and zero in 
on targets that guarantee maximum performance of your facility.  

In order to assure that operating staff are meeting these targets, reports are sent automatically from CPCS database to a highly 
experienced process analyst (regional technical specialist), the project manager as well as other area and regional managers to assure that 
the project process control plan is within the agreed upon parameters to optimize treatment and to meet all regulatory permit and 
enhanced effluent parameters. The ultimate benefit to this approach is that the proper quality controls are in place to continuously 
support the operations of the treatment facility. We will establish a system of regular empirical measurement verification so the data that 
go into these calculations are demonstrated to be meaningful. Examples include draw-down tests, bucket tests, and comparison of 
redundant flow meter readings. 

Plant Data Management 

Every plant needs a single place where all plant operational and compliance data are managed. Data from the field and from the lab will 
be entered into the Hach WIMS database and need not be entered anywhere else. From this single repository of data, a staff can make 
process calculations, generate regulatory reports, and create graphs and tables that reveal status and trends in the operation. This last 
function is the equivalent of backing up to the figurative 30,000 feet to see plant from a broader perspective; it is necessary for a 
responsibly run plant. Data from Hach WIMS can also be input into the Pro2D process model to support process control and optimization 
decisions for the treatment processes.

NEW SYSTEM OF KPIS AND PROCESS CONTROL 
OPTIMIZATION 

 

 



 

  2-25 

With appropriate protection against data corruption, the Hach WIMS will be accessible to all 
operators and each will be able to create formulas as needed to understand and exert control over 
their assigned process.  

A database must be current to be useful as a window into the status of processes. Jacobs will assign 
responsibility for data entry so that data is current, usually within 48 hours of its availability. 

Energy and Chemical Management and Optimization 

Innovative Idea – Blower Modification 

Our initial comparison of the observed DO compared to industry standards 
suggest that the bioreactor system is over-aerated. Reducing the DO would result 
in energy savings, providing that the single stage blowers can turn-down 

sufficiently to meet the lower aeration demand. This issue, and our proposed 
energy-saving solution, is discussed in further detail in Section 2.F – 

Environmental Protection and Mitigation, under the subsection titled “Establishing Plant 
Optimization of Nitrogen Removal”. 

Liquids and Sludge Hauling Approach  

Jacobs will be responsible for solids handling, solids treatment, odor control associated with the 
biogas from the biosolids treatment facilities and the coordination of solids disposal with the City’s 
contractor Synagro.  

Jacobs currently works with Synagro on several of our projects, and we have a great working 
relationship with them. Some of these projects we have direct contact responsibility with them 
while on other contracts the Client has this responsibility. In either case, our historical working 
relationship with Synagro is excellent and we look forward to the opportunity of working with them 
on this project. 

For the treatment of biosolids, we understand that the City may want to thicken biosolids 
during certain periods and dewater biosolids during other times to minimize disposal costs 
whenever possible. Either option for biosolids treatment creates no problem for Jacobs: Nearly all our wastewater treatment projects 
under contract operations involve some aspect of biosolids management and processing of thickened or dewatered sludge. Our 
biosolids programs successfully manage the treatment and disposal (and beneficial reuses, when applicable) of over 40,000 dry 
tons of solids every year. 

Our operations team is highly experienced with biosolids 
treatment—both in biosolids thickening and sludge dewatering. 
Jacobs will develop and implement standard operating procedures 
for the efficient and smooth switchover between biosolids thickening 
and biosolids dewatering operations to meet the demand 
requirements of the City. In addition, unit process control procedures 
and standard operating procedures will be developed by Jacobs for 
biosolids thickening with the gravity belt thickeners and for biosolids 
dewatering with the centrifuges.  



 

  2-26 

It is anticipated that dewatering operations would only occur for an interim period to address 
unforeseen circumstances related to liquid disposal options. Biosolids treatment and disposal 
typically represent some of the largest costs at wastewater treatment facilities and carries a 
certain risk. Jacobs objective is therefore to provide the City with the flexibility to change the 
biosolids handling methodology as needed by having established plans in place to make the 
switch when requested and ensuring that the dewatering equipment is maintained in full 
operating condition. Further, Jacobs is prepared to offer a range of services to optimize both the 
existing thickening operation. Jacobs plans to leverage our industry experience in biosolids to 
optimize the current thickening operations to increase the total solids percent and thus 
minimize amount of volume required to transport. Our experience shows that an increase of 
0.5% to 1% TS could be achieved—which would translate to a potential cost savings in 
reduced hauling costs for the City.  

Our fully integrated firm has the capability to evaluate various options when the current Synagro 
contract expires. A recent example is our work with our client in Michigan, South Huron Valley 
Utility Authority (SHVUA), to implement an alternative biosolids disposal option that produced 
a lower life cycle cost for the client.  

Training 

Jacobs’ commitment to excellence begins with a commitment to people. 
Jacobs recognizes that employee training is a critical element to successful 
O&M and employee satisfaction, and we anticipate over 2,000 hours of O&M 
training in the first year for the New Bedford staff. Our Employee Training 
Plan emphasizes a continuous learning environment that encourages and 
rewards staff for attainment of certifications and credentials that empower 
them with skills and knowledge to deliver top performance in an ever-evolving 
environment.  

Effective, comprehensive training and certification are some of Jacobs’ most 
important service offerings, directly affecting our people’s performance 
quality, skill mix, morale, and long-term potential and growth. Our focus on 
employees and their careers has led us to be consistently ranked highly in 
employee satisfaction by Fortune Magazine and other industry publications. A further discussion of our Training approach is located with our 
Staffing Plan section. 

Commitment to Health, Safety and Security 

Echoing the City’s commitment to superior health and safety (H&S), Jacobs 
continually strives for a strong culture of caring with the goal to consistently 
deliver an incident and injury free environment for all our people. We have a 
long history of keeping our employees safe and consistently outperform 
the industry average in safety, as seen in Exhibit 2.B.15. 

Jacobs’ Culture of Caring, called BeyondZero™, empowers our employees to 
create and sustain a positive, safe and healthy work environment for themselves 
and colleagues, and extends to the communities we serve. It also mirrors our 
respect for the environment with tools and solutions we employ to contribute to 
sustainable business practices. Our culture and our people go beyond following 
rules, procedures, and processes. Our goal is beyond driving statistics to zero. 
We believe our culture will make our people and communities safer and 
healthier. We look for ways to recognize and mitigate risks, on and off the job, 
and we have created a culture of caring where genuine concern for each other 
makes it impossible to tolerate unsafe conditions or behaviors.  

EXHIBIT 2.B.15. JACOBS OUTPERFORMS INDUSTRY 
AVERAGES IN SAFETY YEAR AFTER YEAR 

 

 



 

  2-27 

Jacobs will submit a Safety and Security Plan within 45 days of the 
Commencement Date. During our site visits, we observed some 
distressing safety issues that we would resolve as part of the transition 
activities in the first months of operations, as demonstrated in 
Exhibit 2.B.16. In additional to these examples we noted nearly two dozen 
safety issues that we intend to correct as a part of our O&M Plan 
implementation.  

We will also appoint a Safety Committee that will file a copy of any safety 
recommendations and accident reports, as outlined in Schedule 2 of the RFP. 
Jacob’s takes a comprehensive view to safety responsibility. Supervisors, 
team leaders, managers, and staff have a special obligation through their 
own actions to create a safety culture and climate where those around us 
share concern for their personal safety as well as the safety of their co-
workers. Safety leadership starts at the top of each company and flows down. 
With the total commitment to safety at the corporate level, this commitment 
then flows to the Regional Director and Project Manager, then to function 
leaders such as Operations Manager and the Maintenance Manager, and on 
to other leaders and all workers. The commitment and culture are to always 
achieve excellence in all areas of H&S performance. All Jacobs employees 
are empowered and required to make H&S and zero injuries a reality at 
each job task.  

Accident Prevention Plan 

In conjunction with the development of the O&M Plan, we will create a site-
specific Accident Prevention Plan (APP) to ensure the safety of our 
employees and to protect the City’s equipment and environment. The APP 
and procedures complement our corporate policies. Our H&S team will 
evaluate and tailor the APP and procedures to align with best practices, 
changes in laws and regulations, established Jacobs H&S work procedures, 
and the City’s required components outlined in Schedule 2.7. It will include 
but not be limited to, operations, maintenance, safety management skills, 
laboratory, energy management, chemical handling, confined space entry, 
emergency response, and safety equipment use.  

Project Manager Mike Arnold is responsible for the implementation of the 
safety program and will be closely supported by Regional H&S Manager 
David Haverly.  

Employee training is a critical element of Jacobs’ safety program. Prior to 
starting at a project, the Regional H&S Manager JD Verbrugge will review 
each task and determines the required training for each employee and 
enters this information into our training tracking system (HandS). This 
process will start during the transition period and continue as an ongoing 
requirement for all employees associated with the City’s facilities.

EXHIBIT 2.B.16. CURRENT SAFETY DEFICIENCIES AND JACOBS’ PROPOSED CORRECTIONS 

 



 

  2-29 

Positive Mental Health 

Our employees are our most important assets. We believe that 
each employees’ mental health has a direct impact on safety, morale 
and productivity. Jacobs has implemented a Positive Mental Health 
program that allows employees to receive support for mental 
disorders, financial, legal questions, and other well-being issues. 

Jacobs initially launched mental health training in November 2016 
as part of our global mental health matters’ strategy and now has 
over 1,200 positive mental health champions across the globe. 
These individuals are trained in how to guide staff who have mental 
health concerns or crises to the appropriate level of help. The goal of 
this network of champions is to raise awareness of the risks of mental 
health and encourage open dialogue about mental illness. 

Security 

Understanding plant security has become an important concern of major cities and utilities around the country and around the 
world. Jacobs brings the City unmatched experience in providing physical security for drinking water and wastewater 
utilities. Unlike security firms that specialize in a few types of security systems or have limited experience with wastewater 
utilities, Jacobs’ security team brings vulnerability assessment, design and implementation experience, as well as the 
wastewater system knowledge needed to identify potential weak points. 

We will develop a site-specific Security Plan for the City to review that incorporated elements in draft Schedule 2.7 of the RFP as part of our 
Safety and Security Plan. It is Jacobs policy to provide a secure work environment for our employees and guests and to proactively protect our 
information and property by requiring compliance with the established industry standards and best security management practices. Our 
security plan will address crisis management, business continuity, relocation and evacuations, and general security at the project.  

Any and all persons entering the facility shall be identified and provide appropriate documentation of authorization to have such access and 
all gates, access points and doors to the facilities and structures at the Wastewater Facility will be kept locked, as required in Schedule 2.7 in 
the RFP. In addition to our standard security and asset protection procedures, we will focus on improving physical security for the City’s 
managed assets. Ultimately, we will bring a “Culture of Safety and Security” to this project, as we do at all of our O&M projects.  

Cybersecurity  

Jacobs is a leader in cybersecurity and has done work for confidential clients and agencies like EPA. Water and wastewater controls 
systems have become a target for hackers, and cyber-attacks are on the rise across all sectors of the economy. Jacobs is expert at evaluating 
the Information Technology and Cybersecurity (ITC) needs for our clients, both from an engineering and operational perspective. For example, 
we have implemented one of the most sophisticated cybersecurity evaluations and real-time threat monitoring systems in the industry at our 
North Miami Beach WTP, in conjunction with preparations for this year's Super Bowl. We can offer the City cybersecurity options it wishes to 
include in the tailored Safety and Security Plan we develop with you.  

Example Safety and Security Plan 

A detailed example of Jacobs Health, Safety and Security Plans including the APP and training activities is provide Section 6.I – 
Supplemental Information. It also includes potential cybersecurity components of for our Safety and Security Plan. Written policies and 
procedures can be a very effective way to increase the safety and security posture. When all staff members take personal responsibility for the 
safety and security of the facility and are encouraged to speak up when something is not being done correctly, it empowers staff to take pride in 
their facility.  



 

  2-30 

Transparency and Open Communication/Reporting to the City 

Jacobs overall O&M approach is based on establishing a 
trusting partnership devoted to delivering safe, compliant, and 
efficient operations to your wastewater customers. From 
Day 1, you can expect a partnership focused on 
collaboration, communication, transparency, and a 
commitment to be a good corporate citizen. Our plan places 
significant emphasis on providing full access to your data so 
you can be aware of all aspects of your operations.  

Communication is critical to our mutual success and is 
reflected in our proposed procedures. We encourage day-to 
day communication between City and Jacobs staff at all levels, and empower decision making throughout our organization to provide you with 
immediate attention and response, enabling you to focus on your priorities. We will share our insight, experience, suggestions, and innovative 
approaches to earn the City’s confidence and trust that we are providing the highest level of service at all times. We will work with the City and 
provide continual and transparent communications and reporting such that the City is “up to speed” if an issue does arise, so resolutions 
can be made quickly and without interruption to services.  

Our project communications plan will be updated during negotiations to include the expectations outlined in the Agreement, as well as any 
other preferences your staff may have. Our Project Manager Mike Arnold and his/her entire team will promote the flow of information and 
transparency, following our typical communication structure shown in Exhibit 2.B.17. In addition to frequent informal communications daily, 
our program includes formal weekly, monthly, and quarterly meetings to review plant performance, maintenance activities, and scheduled 
service to major unit processes. 

EXHIBIT 2.B.17. JACOBS’ TYPICAL COMMUNICATION STRUCTURE TO FACILITATE TRANSPARENCY AND COLLABORATION 

 

Annual Innovation Workshop  

As an enhancement to the traditional management approach, we are including an Annual Innovation Workshop aimed at 
continuous improvement of the partnership. For this important gathering, we’ll bring together our executive sponsor and a 
team of O&M resources, plus three hand-selected utility experts chosen to reflect then current needs, to review the prior 

year’s accomplishments and establish new goals that address the City’s evolving needs and long-term vision. This 

 

Customer service and client centricity form the 
hallmark of Jacobs’ performance and represent an 
important reason why clients choose to do business 
with us. Jacobs’ commitment to providing 
exceptional customer service to our clients extends 
to the communities we serve and includes a strong 
emphasis on being a good corporate citizen. 



 

  2-31 

important annual meeting is a way to ensure the program is continuously looking forward to future needs and trends to ensure our operations 
partnership remains on a path of continuous improvement while avoiding complacency. 

Transparent Reporting 

Jacobs will provide and maintain well-documented records of operations, maintenance, laboratory, personnel, training, safety, process 
control, daily inspections, materials, alarms, and any other significant events. All records and reporting will meet MADEP requirements as well 
as those required by the City. Our goal is to serve as an extension of your staff and bring the best value to your customers. In addition to the 
compliance and NPDES discharge reporting we discuss in Section 2.G – Process Monitoring, QA/QC Reporting to City and Regulatory Agencies, 
Jacobs will also maintain records and prepare reports to the City and other project stakeholders (as appropriate) that will include: 

 Monthly Operations and Maintenance Report – Jacobs’ Project Manager Mike Arnold will be responsible for preparing and delivering to 
the City a detailed Operations and Maintenance Report. The report will include: O&M activities; process control regulatory activities and 
issues; laboratory analyses performed, staffing and resources (including any changes in personnel);health and safety(including accidents 
records); training activities; process control; daily inspections; IPP activities; significant alarms; maintenance plans and activities; permit 
and compliance results; equipment status; and other relevant information. 

 Annual Report – Jacobs’ O&M team will be responsible for preparing and presenting to the City an Annual Operations Report that would 
review the past year’s activities and planned activities for the upcoming year. This report will be provided to the City within 45 days of 
the end of the year and would cover: recommended capital repairs and replacements as well as recommended capital improvements; 
annual flows of wastewater treated; and financial issues, including actual expenditures and any adjustments required in annual 
payments. In support of this Annual Report, Jacobs will also prepare a listing of Recommendation for Additional Capital Improvements, 
which would be provided to the City 60 days prior to the end of fiscal year. 

Commitment to Community Benefits and Sustainable 
Operations 

Jacobs is aware of the City’s signatory to the US Conference of 
Mayor’s greenhouse gas goals for 2028, thereby making 
sustainable operations and achieving measurable results 
important to this project. Jacobs shares this commitment to 
sustainability. We first launched our OM Sustainability Program 
in 2009 and have produced outstanding results for our O&M 
clients as shown in Exhibit 2.B.18. Producing real impact, the 
program drives continuous improvement focused on reductions 
and/or savings in chemicals, energy, fuel, water use, waste 
minimization, or emissions.  

Another key component of our O&M Sustainability Program is to 
help build and support sustainable communities. As such, we also 
focus on fostering stewardship activities related to community 
enhancement projects or environmental benefits such as 
transitioning to durable goods or local ecosystem restoration.  

EXHIBIT 2.B.18. JACOBS’ O&M SUSTAINABILITY PROGRAM SUCCESSES 

 



 

  2-32 

Community Engagement 

Jacobs staff are active in all the communities where we operate, and community 
involvement in the greater New Bedford area will be a part of our O&M Plan. We are 
excited about the vitality of the New Bedford community and have already participated in 
the recent Bike New Bedford Day event. We look forward to supporting and engaging with 
the diverse opportunities the New Bedford community presents.   

Jacobs’ community engagement activities will 
be tailored to the City’s values and interests 
and could include: 

 Educational outreach—particularly with a 
STEM focus 

 Community environmental stewardship 
such as participating in future outreach 
involving water/wastewater services  

 Support of various organizations such as 
the Pioneer Valley Riverfront Club events,  

 Support for vulnerable communities 
such as the Meals on Wheels and 
food pantries 

 Partnerships with local 
organizations to support economic 
and community development such 
as the local chamber of commerce. 

Unique Opportunities for STEM Education and Community Benefits 

We see a unique opportunity to partner with local colleges such as Bristol Community College and its wastewater treatment plant 
operators and laboratory technologies program to provide internship opportunities for study areas relevant to the treatment plant’s 
work. We discuss our plans for this paid internship program in Section 2.C – Staffing Plan.  

Additionally, we regularly reach out to local elementary, middle and high schools to establish relationships and curriculums for the student 
that teach them about the role of treatment plants and the science behind them. Students then visit and tour the plant to see the science in 
action. Educating adults and the community at large is another 
component of our STEM education focus. At community events 
and local Earth Day events, for example, we can bring our 
wastewater treatment booth that educates the community on the 
value of wastewater treatment and how it works. Kids and adults 
alike love to learn about the “bugs” that make it possible. 

Site Tours 

Jacobs intends to conduct site tours throughout the year at the 
WWTF. The purpose of these tours is to increase the public’s 
awareness and understanding of wastewater treatment, and the 
public’s role in pollution prevention. Jacobs plant tours will be 
tailored to various types of tour participants and in addition will 
make available educational materials for tour participants to 
read about the facilities and wastewater transportation, 
operations and treatment. 

In 2018, Jacobs’ O&M staff 
tallied 2,647 hours of 
community volunteering among 
our 263 project sites, and 
21,908 hours total since 2009. 



 

  2-33 

Additional O&M Plan Elements 

Additional elements of our O&M Plan are discussed in other sections of our proposal: 

 Detailed training approach in Section 2.C – Staffing Plan and 6.0 Supplemental Information 

 Approach to staffing schedules and shifts in Section 2.C – Staffing Plan 

 Emergency response in Section 2.E – Emergency Operations and in 6.0 Supplemental Information 

 Process modeling and optimization of nitrogen removal in Section 2.F – Environmental Protection and Mitigation 

 Odor and noise management and mitigation in Section 2.F – Environmental Protection and Mitigation 

 Environmental compliance sampling, reporting, and laboratory management in Section 2.G – Process Monitoring, QA/QC Reporting to 
City and Regulatory Agencies and in Section 6.E – Supplemental Information 

C. Staffing Plan 
Jacobs recognizes the importance of having a fully trained, motivated and certified staff onsite supported by a 
strong network of offsite expert resources to deliver high quality and reliable services to the City and your 
customers. Our plan provides the staffing management levels the City desires and efficiently organizes the staff 
and orchestrates the shift schedules to guarantee superior operations, maintenance, and administrative 
coverage for the managed assets.  

Our team structure, including our team organization chart, and our staff leadership are discussed in Section 2.A. – Company/Team 
Information. Project Manager Michael Arnold, with support from Operations Manager Adam Federau, will lead our Operations team. 
Maintenance Manager Paul Horigan will manage the inspections and preventative, corrective and predictive maintenance program. Laboratory 
Manager Liz Tepper will manage laboratory testing services and oversee our compliance sampling plan. She will also have responsibility for 
managing our proposed internship position focused on laboratory QA/QC program as well process control sampling. These internships are 
offered to local area students and will serve as a feeder program in the future to fill in vacancies in the organization.  

Jacobs’ Optimized Staffing Approach  

Though our extensive review of the City’s current 
operations, the Jacobs team has identified a number of 

efficiencies and optimizations that will allow us to operate 
the City’s facilities at their expected performance 

standards—or better—but with a more streamlined staffing approach for 
all three alternatives. The efficiencies we have identified allow us to provide 
a lower staffing total for Base Bid/Alternative 1 while adding pump station 
O&M under Alternatives 2 or 3 with only one additional. Our optimized shift 
totals shown in Exhibit 2.C.1 provide for 24/7/365 operations coverage and 
are based on a two-week schedule plan. (The totals do not include our 
Regional Director/Transition Manager Kevin Dahl. We also intend to offer 
one internship position throughout the year to supplement our staffing plan, 
which is also not included in the staffing totals shown.)  

The efficiencies, discussed in more detail in other sections of this proposal, 
are summarized below: 

 Adjusted organization of the workforce by putting more emphases 
on maintenance and proposing a more efficient shift schedule for 
the operators 

 Route optimization of the daily pump station monitoring visits and 
investing in installation two (2) grinders at the Welby and Industrial

Park pump stations to eliminate the need to rake manual bar screens, thereby reduce labor time required for each pump station visits 
(These initiatives will also improve safety.) 

 Streamlined fecal coliform and Enterococci analyses by switching from the membrane filtration method to the IDEXX Colilert method, 
which is approved for use by the US EPA and MADEP, provides more accurate results, and is significantly more user-friendly than the 
membrane filtration method—reducing sampling time and affording more time to lab technicians to perform other functions  

 Eliminating a dedicated onsite manager for odor & noise, to be replaced with Jacobs dedicated Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) for odor 
and noise to assist the plant staff with critical mitigation measures and O&M issues. Day-to-day oversight of scrubber performance 
will remain with the onsite staff and management team.  

We recognize that the reduction of staff totals at the Wastewater Facility will require coordination with MassDEP to adjust the NPDES permit, 
which we are prepared to support.  

12-Hour Shifts for Enhanced WWTF Staffing and Operations 

In order to enhance efficiency, 
Jacobs has developed a 12-
hour shift schedule. This 

approach allows for fewer total 
full-time employees (FTE) in the project 
under the Base Bid/but will schedule more of 
the operators at one time during the shift, 
thereby increasing the total amount of 
output from the staff. We would undertake to 
negotiate this option with the union.  

Operators would normally be scheduled for 
rotating 12-hour shifts, 24 hours a day and 
seven days a week. We would normally 
schedule four (4) Operators on the day shift—
one Lead Operator and three (3) additional 
Operators. There would be one operator on the 
overnight shift to provide continuous coverage 
at the plant. The shift schedule shown in 
Exhibit 2.C.2. outlines who is scheduled when 
over a two-week period. An advantage of 12-
hour shifts is that each Operator is normally 
scheduled for seven consecutive days off every 
month, resulting in a happier, more productive work force with exceptional work/life balance that also has built in overtime. 

Optimum staff functionality requires assignment of responsibility to individuals at a level that challenges them, but at which they are also 
effective. Our approach calls on Operators to specialize in a process, which promotes greater ownership and engagement rather than only to 
execute routine tasks. Jacobs will divide plant functions into process areas and assign responsibility for each to an Operator, giving them the 
opportunity and responsibility to specialize in that treatment process. Operators staff will be cross-trained as well to provide flexibility and 
adequate staffing coverage in the case of vacations or illnesses. Our 12-hour shift schedule further supports adequate staffing levels with three 
Operators available during the daytime shift when vacations or illnesses occur,   

Alternatives 2 and 3: Pump Station Operations 

Jacobs understands the City’s desire to maintain operational performance while potentially consolidating the WWTF and pump station 
operations under a single entity responsibility. To that end, our staffing approach to Alternatives 2 and 3 assigns two operators on a 10-hour, 
seven-day rotating schedule to visit all pump stations in the system. Additionally, we have assigned one full-time mechanic to the pump 
station alternatives as noted under Maintenance Team below. Jacobs has determined that, through our efficiencies, the staffing levels required 
for Alternative 2 (with 29 total pump stations) and Alternative 3 (with 12 largest pump station) to be the same, thereby providing greater 
value to the City should you select Alternative 2. Our proposal is based on Alternative 2.

Maintenance Team 

Paul Horrigan, a Certified Maintenance Reliability Technician (CMRT), will lead 
the maintenance team of nine FTEs under Base Bid/Alternative 1 or a team of 
10 FTEs with the addition of Alternative 2 or 3. Maintenance personnel will 
include individuals with the City’s expected skills: (not limited to) electricians, 
plumbing/pipefitting, welding and instrumentation and controls. As shown in 
Exhibit 2.C.1., four maintenance mechanics will be assigned primarily to the 
WWTF, and one additional maintenance mechanic will be assigned primarily to the pump stations under Alternatives 2 and 3. Two utility 
workers and two electricians/I&C personnel will also assist the maintenance team. The maintenance team will be further supported by an 
Asset Manager to organize work plans and ensure the right parts are available prior to starting work. The maintenance team will have 
responsibility for ongoing plant upkeep and painting of the assets, an important component of our asset management approach to prolong 
the life of the City’s aging equipment.  

All maintenance personnel will be expected to obtain higher level certifications such as CMRT and CRL. Maintenance staff will perform 
PM/PdM and CM work as well as perform inspections, cleaning, and painting efforts. Pump stations will be visited daily. Cross-training will 
occur where appropriate to provide flexibility and ensure adequate coverage during vacations or illness. The Maintenance team will also be 
supported by the Operations team as needed and especially during wet weather events. Most of the maintenance team will be scheduled 
Monday through Friday, but on-call staff will be available to address any significant issues promptly.  

Offsite, Regional Support Resources 

Our Regional Support Resources bring specific expertise the City seeks, such as mechanical and I&C support (Kyle Arnold), 
millwright (Rich Lang) and electrician (Eric Giles), backed by the considerable additional regional resources to provide a high 
level of support to the on-site team. These staff and other national SMEs can be tapped on an as-needed basis to ensure 
consistency in quality and reliability of service. Our regional resources are also available to train or address complex process, 

maintenance, or system issues on an as-needed basis. In case of the prolonged absence of a staff member, our regional and 
even national resources can also be tapped to temporarily or permanently staff the position. Please see Section 2.A. – 

Company/Team Information for more details these Regional Resources. 

Developing an Effective Operations Team 

Long-term effective and efficient operations will require not only a technically sound operational strategy, but also a staff that 
understands the principles of treatment and is organized and led in a way that it applies that understanding in changing conditions. In 
short, a reliable operation and the ability to optimize it, requires a high level of staff functionality. Jacobs is committed to staff development 
that can elevate New Bedford’s facilities to the next level of performance. 

Professional Development/Training 

Jacobs’ project training programs are always tailored to specific project needs. We will complete individual employee training 
needs assessments, which will guide our training topics and schedule. A custom training curriculum will then be compiled 
based on everyone’s assessed base skills, job descriptions, and training requirements. The Transition Team will develop a 
targeted and specific training plan within the 30 days prior to the Commencement Date. Please see Section 3.D. – 

Employee Transition Plan and Compensation Package for further discussion. In Section 6.G – Supplemental Information, we 
provide Jacobs’ typical approach to building highly functional staff at projects we operate.

Treatment Systems and Processes 

NHSA (The Authority) owns and operates two WWTFs (Adams Street and River Road), 106 miles of combined sewer (including interceptors, 
siphons and force mains), 9 wastewater pump stations, 2 wet weather pump stations (H1 and H5), 17 CSO Regulators, 10 CSO Outfalls, and 
11 Solids/Floatables Screening Facilities. 

The Adams Street WWTF serves the municipalities of Hoboken, Weehawken and Union City with a service area of 2.6 square miles. It is 
permitted by New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) to discharge 20.8 MGD. It has a dry weather design flow of 24 
MGD and a wet weather capacity of 40 MGD. The Adams Street WWTF treats wastewater to secondary treatment standards through several 
unit processes including grit/screenings removal, primary clarification, deep bed trickling filters, dissolved air floatation/secondary filtration, 
effluent UV disinfection, and solids handling. The solids handling system utilizes belt thickening and is then transferred to Passaic Valley 
Sewerage Commission for disposal. 

The River Road WWTF serves the municipalities of Weehawken, Union City, and West New York with a service area of 1.4 square miles. It is 
permitted by NJDEP to discharge 10 MGD and has a wet weather capacity of 20 MGD. The River Road WWTF service area treats wastewater to 
secondary treatment standards through several unit processes including grit/screenings removal, microstrainers, deep bed trickling filters, 
secondary clarification, effluent chemical disinfection and solids handling. The solids handling process utilizes belt thickening and is then 
transferred to the Passaic Valley Sewerage Commission for disposal. 

Capital Improvements and Retro Fittings 

Jacobs provides capital upgrades when requested by The Authority. For example; following Hurricane Sandy we installed new electrical 
feeders and electrical manholes within the plant site that were damaged by salt water intrusion. Other capital projects we have completed 
include pumping equipment damaged by flooding due to Sandy.  

Odor Control Facilities 

NHSA uses carbon adsorption for odor control at the Hoboken facility and uses a wet scrubber at the West New York facility. Hoboken has 
three carbon tanks, and one carbon drum used for sludge truck loading ventilation. West New York has 4 carbon tanks, and one carbon drum 
also used for sludge truck loading ventilation. There is also a total of four carbon odor control tanks in the collection system: one per each of 
the following locations - 5th Street Pump Station, 11th Street Pump Station, 18th Street Pump Station, and the WNY-1 Solids and Floatables 
Screening Facility.

Treatment Systems and Processes 

Wastewater enters the treatment plant, flows through a screen, which removes large objects that could damage equipment. The remaining 
solids are minute particles that fall to the bottom of a sedimentation tank. The particles form a mass of solids called primary sludge. This 
sludge is removed and converted to biogas to help create energy to power the treatment plant. 

An activated sludge process based on pumping air into a tank which promotes microbial growth in wastewater. The oxygen helps the bacteria 
break down organic matter and remove contaminants. 

The wastewater from the aeration basin is slowed down and any remaining sludge is separated and removed from the wastewater. 

The wastewater is then disinfected with sodium hypochlorite to remove any disease-causing organisms and ensure that water leaving the plant 
meets the water quality standards set by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality. 

Following the treatment, the water is discharged to the Columbia River.  

Capital Improvements and Retro Fittings 

Jacobs provides full contract operations services for a 20-mgd WWTF pump stations, laboratory and biosolids handling while also achieving 
net zero energy through proactive management of the cogeneration and fats, oils and grease (FOG) facilities.

Treatment Systems and Processes 

The Westside Wastewater Treatment Facility (WSWRF) provides treatment for municipal wastewater from the southern and western sections of 
Vancouver and has on-site sludge incineration capabilities. The facility has an average maximum monthly design capacity of 28.26 MGD, with 
a maximum daily flow of 41.1 MGD. The facility performs primary treatment in primary clarifiers, secondary treatment by activated sludge and 
secondary clarifiers, and disinfection by ultraviolet radiation. Residual primary solids are degritted, thickened and stored. Waste activated 
sludge is normally wasted to the tank or to the gravity belt thickeners, with the option of conditioning in an aeration basin. The two solid trains 
are mixed and thickened with gravity belt thickeners and dewatered with a centrifuge. The facility operates a sewage sludge incinerator as its 
primary means of solids disposal. Foul odors from various plant processes are collected and treated in a packed tower scrubber for hydrogen 
sulfide gas removal. 

The Marine Park Wastewater Treatment Facility (MPWTF) provides treatment for municipal wastewater from the northern and eastern sections 
of Vancouver. The facility has an average maximum monthly design capacity of 16.10 MGD, with a peak maximum hourly flow of 41.8 MGD. 
The facility performs primary treatment in primary clarifiers, secondary treatment by activated sludge and secondary clarifiers, and 
disinfection by ultraviolet radiation. Residual primary solids are degritted, thickened then pumped also with the waste activated sludge, via a 
pipeline to the WSWTF where solids are mixed, dewatered and incinerated. 

The lagoon system is designed specifically to treat industrial waste that is generated from three food manufacturers in Vancouver. Effluent 
from the lagoon is discharged to the headworks of the WSWTF to be further treated by the activated sludge system prior to discharge to the 
Columbia River. The lagoon has an average maximum monthly design capacity of 3.2 MGD. The system is an aerated and facultative 3 cell 
process to remove high strength BOD and soluble BOD. 



 

  2-42 

Jacobs also operates and maintains the 8 major lift stations within the collections system that are integral to ensuring wastewater is conveyed 
to the appropriate treatment facility headworks for processing. Lift stations vary in design from submersible pumps to dry well applications 
with odor and corrosion control processes. 

Capital Improvements and Retro Fittings 

Services provided by Jacobs include the operation, maintenance and management of the two wastewater treatment plants, lift stations, sludge 
incinerator and industrial pretreatment lagoon operations. Maintenance activities include preventive, corrective and predictive procedures 
performed on all treatment plant, lagoon and lift station equipment, so it can be maintained in accordance with manufacture 
recommendations and industry standards. Jacobs also provides capital improvement recommendations and are undertaken by Jacobs as 
directed by the City, including engineering support, regulatory compliance support and major SCADA upgrades.

July 2016, TSS December 2016. The City received a notice of violation dated January 9, 2019 from the Washington Department of Ecology 
for a wastewater influent bypass that occurred in September 2017 due to a power disruption at an electrical substation that caused a loss of 
power to the Westside Wastewater Treatment Plant and a wastewater influent bypass that occurred in October 2017 due to calibration of level 
sensors that control pumping from the influent wet well. The City received a notice of violation dated April 5, 2018 from the Southwest Clean 
Air Agency for failure to calibrate the thermocouples on the fluidized bed incinerator during calendar year 2017.  

E. Emergency Operations 
Sometimes the unexpected occurs and Jacobs stands ready to respond with the superior services that are the cornerstone our O&M project 
delivery. This can include being a part of our client’s emergency response team when emergencies (natural or human-made) threaten safety, 
property, or compliant operations. Jacobs operates or supports 20+ municipal and industrial wastewater facilities in the Northeast, whose 
personnel could respond to any emergency in support of our onsite team or the City within hours. With 13 supporting offices and more than 
more than 5,000 associates in the Northeast, our team is equipped and committed to providing immediate, rapid, efficient, and effective 
assistance to the City—whether for hurricanes, flooding, wildfires, nuclear, hazardous wastes, or equipment failure. Our experts 
understand the level of resources essential in your time of need and will adapt to provide you with the most technically effective and feasible 
solutions, while delivering work products expeditiously and within budget. 

 



 

  2-43 

Should events require it, our project team will be supported by hundreds of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) specialists and 
emergency response experienced professionals. This broader pool of resources is crucial because events that require emergency response 
often affect nearby communities, rendering their resources unavailable as they respond to their own local emergencies. Regional Director 
Kevin Dahl and Project Manager Michael Arnold are empowered to access and provide the necessary resources to New Bedford. To meet the 
objective for high-level responsiveness and ease of access to our temporary personnel and equipment resources in time of need, we have 
organized our team structure and approach to provide: 

 Continuity of operations planning 

 Pre-disaster plans and protocols 

 Contingency and emergency response plans 

 Before-event planning (for storms or emergencies with a known lead 
time) and after-event planning 

 Documenting our disaster response to increase maximum benefit of 
federal funding 

 Local and regional resources for emergency 
response 

 Access to our FEMA certified respondents 

 Access to our integrated suite of applications to 
support implementation of the National Incident 
Management System (NIMS).  

Emergency Operations Plan 

For the City of New Bedford, our plan will include preparing for and 
responding to a broad range of situations, including all elements 
required under draft Schedule 2 of the RFP with the City. Our 
Emergency Response Plans (ERPs) typically including training 
personnel in procedures and appropriate use of emergency equipment. 
They also include critical coordination with the local community and 
other agencies and will integrate the similar plans we developed 
previous for the REBF operations. 

Our comprehensive ERP will incorporate reliability and communication features to minimize the occurrence of emergencies where possible 
and to enhance safety, response, and communications when emergencies occur. Because it is impossible to predict the exact nature of every 
possible emergency, our program provides a comprehensive communication, training, and resource-based plan that manages the 
broadest range of possible emergencies. A summary of emergency response measures for possible events is provided in Exhibit 2.E.1. We 
have provided a detailed discussion of our Emergency Response Plan elements in Section 6.F – Supplemental Information. 

EXHIBIT 2.E.1. SUMMARY OF TYPICAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN MEASURES 

Event Approach 

Chemical spill Individual safety data sheets (SDS) will be used to determine proper cleanup and control measures. In the event of a large 
chemical spill, notify local Fire Department and the City. 

Pipe, valve, pump, and other 
equipment failure 

Jacobs will perform an initial and periodic condition assessment of these assets. Critical equipment spares could be placed 
in inventory so emergency replacements can be made. 

Process failure Increase treatment plant solids retention time (SRT) and adjust aeration basis dissolved oxygen to hold inventory under 
aeration and minimize wasting. 

Power failure In the event of a partial or complete power failure, procedures are followed to minimize equipment downtime. The City will be 
immediately contacted when a power failure occurs. To determine the location of the outage, a complete list of all meter 
numbers for lift stations and other unit processes will be located at the operator desks and in the back of the onsite ERP. 

Emergency telephone numbers An emergency contact list with site numbers will be posted at each worksite and include: project contacts, including project 
manager, safety director, the Public Safety Department, police, fire, and ambulance for surrounding communities—
emergency (911) and non-emergency numbers, area hospitals, and serious incident reporting and crisis management. 

Emergency equipment 
inventory 

In the event that emergency equipment is a rental item or provided as a specialty service by a vendor, agreements for 24/7 
service will be put in place in advance so there will be no interruption in service.

Customer Service Response to Odor and Noise Complaints 

The Jacobs team will make odor and noise complaints a priority as they have the potential to noticeably impact New Bedford citizens. Jacobs 
approaches these complaints as a priority maintenance condition because odors emanating from facilities could indicate an illicit discharge or 
hazardous substance introduced into the system. Similarly, noise complaints can reflect less than optimal maintenance conditions.  

Our intention to respond to non-emergency and odor and noise complaints will be on a 24/7 basis with on-call staff. As requested in Schedule 
2 of the draft service agreement, Jacobs will provide a 24-hour toll-free phone line and answering service that will inform operators 
immediately of an odor or noise complaint or emergency and document the call and time. We recognize the City’s “zero tolerance” approach 
to odor and noise issues and will work with the City to craft a tailored response approach that meets the City’s desired goal. Details on our 
approach to odor and noise issues are presented in Section 2.F. – Environmental and Mitigation in our discussion, “Performing a Zero 
Tolerance Odor and Noise Program.” 

F. Environmental Protection and Mitigation 
Jacobs is fully committed to delivering on the City of New Bedford’s objective of operating in full 
compliance with all applicable regulations, statutes, and permits.  

Jacobs’ Environmental Compliance Program is an organized, systematic approach to maintain compliance with environmental, legal, and 
business requirements. Jacobs has extensive expertise in all pertinent areas of environmental regulations including the Clean Water Act, the 
Clean Air Act, EPCRA, RCRA, Biosolids management, Industrial Pretreatment, Laboratory management and Stormwater regulations. Jacobs 
actively develops strong working relationships with regulators at the Federal, State and local levels. We believe in complete transparency in 
our reporting to the regulators and to the communities that we serve.  

Our Environmental Compliance Program is designed to generate consistent and predictable compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, 
and standards. Our goal is “Perfect Compliance and Perfect Reporting”. The information developed from our program will: 

 Alert New Bedford staff to situations that require special attention and possibly require calling on assistance from regional, 
corporate, or other specialists to support onsite staff. 

 Generate legally defensible data and records. 

Jacobs will implement a suite of Project Compliance Tools for the City of New Bedford to assure long-term compliance with 
environmental regulations, permit conditions and the Division of Marine Fisheries MOU including:  

 A comprehensive training program including project start-up, Jacobs-developed video modules and on-going training provided via web-
based delivery mechanisms along with onsite training. 

 An NPDES permit Sample Tracking Tool with multiple layers of oversight to ensure that sampling is performed as required. 

 In-depth NPDES and air permit evaluation tools to ensure that all permit requirements are identified and fully understood.  

 Biosolids and IPP tracking and assessment tools. 

 Utilization of a SharePoint site, entitled Project Compliance Tools, which is available to all associates. The tools described above, as well 
as other tools and compliance-related information, can be found on the SharePoint site. 

Because a great deal of the information necessary for permit compliance begins in the laboratory, Jacobs has developed a suite of tools 
including a QA/QC manual, the QC-Stats software program and participation in third-party Proficiency Testing programs to ensure the 
performance of the laboratory to yield data of unquestionable integrity.  

Jacobs has a comprehensive Internal Auditing program to verify the adherence of our projects to the permit and other regulatory 
requirements.

Our approach to Mitigation 

As a facility operator, there may be situations where violations occur due to circumstances beyond operational control or in 
rare instances, due to operator error. Jacobs has an excellent reputation among regulatory agencies, and we are committed 
to full disclosure and remedying situations that may arise even when an excursion occurs due to physical plant limitations, 
storm events, illegal or unanticipated discharges into the collection system, or other activities outside of our operational 

control. Jacobs has developed a comprehensive program for mitigating adverse environmental impacts in emergency and 
accidental spill situations. Our response to any incident of non-compliance, including effluent quality outside of permit limits, unintentional 
spills or bypasses, or process upsets, is to: 

 Immediately assess the situation 

 Apply the resources necessary to return to compliance 

 Determine any additional precautions to be put in place 
to prevent repeat or future occurrences 

 Mitigate the impact through immediate cleanup and restoration 

 Report accurately and promptly to the City of New Bedford and to 
the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection, US 
Environmental Protection Agency and other regulatory agencies 
and stakeholders as required. 

As necessary, we will draw upon Jacobs’ regional and corporate technical resources to assist our onsite team in resolving process challenges or 
assist in determining appropriate mitigation steps. We maintain critical equipment lists, vendors, contact information, and response 
agreements so we may access any additional outside resources deemed beneficial to the specific situation. 

Jacobs will be responsible for regulatory fines or penalties assessed for non-compliance resulting from the negligent action of Jacobs during 
the contract term. 

Jacobs has developed a tool known as the “Preliminary Excursion Guide”. This mandatory tool is utilized for internal reporting of any instance 
or suspected incidence of regulatory noncompliance at our O&M projects. All noncompliant events are investigated, and a detailed root cause 
analysis is performed. A conference call discussing the event with compliance and technical experts, as well as upper management, is required 
for these events. The goal of the call is to fully understand the cause of the event and bring the necessary resources to bear to prevent 
recurrence of this incident. 

Changes in Regulatory Requirements 

Jacobs devotes considerable effort and resources to identifying potential changes to regulations that could have an impact on the 
communities that we serve. Once a regulation is proposed, it is thoroughly reviewed, and a determination of its impact is developed, both in 
terms of requirements for capital investment as well as operational changes that may be required to comply with the terms of the proposed 
regulation. Jacobs will provide assistance to the City of New Bedford for the purpose of negotiating the impacts of proposed changes ensuring 
there is sound reasoning and cause for the changes. We then provide guidance to our clients, well in advance of the regulation going final, on 
the requirements of the regulation and its potential impact on the facilities and operations.  

Integrated City Capital Improvements into Long-term Operations 

Jacobs will work closely with the City to integrate our solutions and innovations with the City’s capital improvement program and in 
cooperation with the City’s engineering consultant.

Establishing Plant Optimization of Nitrogen 
Removals  

Our technical approach is founded on leading edge operations and 
maintenance strategies supported by dedicated experts, and it 
continually evolves as new technologies emerge. In the following 
section we discuss our technical approach in detail for several our 
solutions and investments. We will continuously share our insight, 
experience, suggestions, and innovative approaches to earn the 
City’s confidence and trust that we are always providing the highest 
level of service.  

Understanding of Nitrogen Issues 

Jacobs recognizes that the City of New Bedford will 
likely see the establishment of effluent nitrogen 
limits in the near future. While there is uncertainty 
in what the limits will be, Jacobs offers both 

tremendous experience operating facilities with some 
of the strictest nutrient limits and a world-class engineering practice 
with experience designing and optimizing nutrient removal facilities. 
We stand ready to assist the City and your consultant’s in permit 
negotiations, treatment studies, and plant optimization.  

The most recent NPDES permit, issued in September 2008, requires 
that the City of New Bedford identify and quantify major sources of 
nitrogen in the influent and develop an approach to optimize plant 
operation to reduce nitrogen discharges in the plant effluent. The 
City has begun to monitor and report influent total kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and effluent ammonia on a regular basis. The average influent TKN 
has been approximately 38 mg/L and effluent ammonia has been approximately 13 mg/L over the years 2016–2019.  

The Jacobs Team visited the City’s facilities on December 11 and 12, 2019. Overall, our team devoted hundreds of hours to a detailed review 
of the WWTF to understand the limitations of the current plant configuration and to identify opportunities to enhance the facilities operation to 
meet future nutrient discharge limits, including total nitrogen.  

Achieving Nitrogen Removal 

Our technical approach applies a collaborative combination of operations, maintenance, and process expertise critical to ensuring that 
treatment is stable and optimal. This includes using a whole plant process model developed to optimize and potentially upgrade the 
treatment process. The process model is a wastewater plant simulation program that calculates the mass balance for over 70 different 
wastewater components and performance of the various treatment flow streams, based on plant influent flows and loads, treatment plant 
processes and configuration, operational criteria, and chemical dosages. Jacobs’ wastewater process simulation team has expertise in 
numerous process simulator platforms including BiowinTM, SumoTM, and Jacobs’ internally developed Pro2D. 

Historical data (2018 - 2019) provided by the City allowed Jacobs to construct a calibrated whole plant process model to evaluate 
opportunities to achieve nitrogen removal at the facility.  

Model results show that with some moderate modifications the activated sludge system can achieve biological nitrogen removal during spring 
and summer months. At design conditions (30 mgd), this configuration will reduce effluent TN to less than 10mg/L. At current conditions, this 
configuration would result in effluent TN less than 8 mg/L. A more substantial upgrade may be necessary to ensure consistent results at colder 
water temperatures. Upgrade to existing basins would provide year-round stability and the needed biological inventory to achieve greater 
levels of nitrogen removal. Because of the limited available space at the facility, an attached growth retrofit of the existing basins would provide a 
path to meeting more stringent effluent TN limits. Attached growth processes utilize biomass that grows on inert surfaces rather than suspended 
in liquid as found in conventional activated sludge processes. Jacobs has created a Pro2D model to determine the feasibility of this type of retrofit, 
and the result show that effluent TN of less than 8 mg/L at all temperatures. At warmer temperatures, an effluent TN < 5 mg/L is possible.  



 

  2-47 

The required modifications are summarized in Exhibit 2.F.1 and illustrated in Exhibit 2.F.2  

EXHIBIT 2.F.1. SUMMARY OF PROPOSED ACTIVATED SLUDGE SYSTEM MODIFICATIONS TO ACHIEVE BIOLOGICAL NUTRIENT REMOVAL 

Approach Rationale/Benefit 

Verify influent wastewater 
characterization 

Biological nutrient removal requires specific constituent in influent the influent, specifically soluble COD, and 
sufficient alkalinity for nitrification. Verification is required to determine ultimate nutrient removal ability. 

Convert existing selector basins to 
anoxic basins and add nitrified recycle 
pumps 

By using the selector basins as anoxic zones, soluble carbon in the primary effluent can be used as the carbon source for 
denitrification. The nitrified recycle pumps will return the nitrate formed by nitrification (ammonia removal) to the anoxic 
zones for denitrification. 

Convert portion of Aerobic Zone 1 to 
anoxic zone 

In order to maximize the extent of denitrification in the available basin volume, a portion of the aerated basins would 
be converted to un-aerated/anoxic.  

Increase activated sludge solids 
retention time (SRT) 

Plant design criteria and operational data indicate a relatively short SRT (consistent with a BOD removal facility). To 
achieve full nitrification, the SRT needs to be increased to 6-10 days. 

As shown in Exhibit 2.F.2, the anoxic zones are created out of the current selector zones. We would then make the first existing zone partially 
anoxic. The remainder of that first zone is aerobic. 

Potential Mitigation Innovation: Implementing an Ammonia Based Aeration Control to Reduce Power Consumption 

With any plant modification for nitrogen removal comes an increase in the amount of air required for treatment. Aeration for the Bioreactors 
consists of blowers and fine bubble diffusers to provide the necessary oxygen for the biological treatment system to degrade organic carbon 
and nitrify ammonia. The aeration system is controlled based on dissolved oxygen (DO) readings within the bioreactors. The DO is measured 
using a probe located within the aerobic zone of each aeration basin. This measurement is used within the control system to adjust the control 
valves to each bioreactor changing the amount of air delivered. As the valves adjust, the pressure in the main air header changes 
proportionally. The single stage aeration blowers theoretically will adjust their variable vanes to maintain the header pressure within a 
selected range, or ultimately turn blowers on/off. During the site visit, at the short snapshot of time when the SCADA system was reviewed, the 
DO was observed to be between 7 and 10 mg/L. 

EXHIBIT 2.F.2. POTENTIAL MODIFICATIONS TO THE ACTIVATED SLUDGE SYSTEM TO IMPROVE NITROGEN REMOVAL  
Based upon our 
results from modeling 
the New Bedford 
facility in our 
proprietary PRO2D 
model, Jacobs 
proposes 
modifications in 
shown 2.F.2 to 
include anoxic zones 
created out of the 
current selector 
zones. We would also 
make the first existing 
zone partially anoxic 
with the remainder of 
that first zone aerobic. 
 

An initial comparison of the observed DO compared to industry standards suggest that the facility is over-aerated. Reducing the DO would 
result in energy savings, providing that the single stage blowers can turn-down sufficiently to meet the lower aeration demand. In the future 
when nitrogen limits have been implemented, additional energy savings can also be realized by upgrading the aeration control system to 



 

  2-48 

utilize ammonia-nitrogen as the control variable. Ammonia-based aeration control (ABAC) has grown in popularity recently due to allowing 
utilities to fine tune their biological treatment system to only nitrify as much as the discharge permit requires. 

ABAC is an extension of a traditional DO control system by using a measured ammonia concentration in the bioreactors to adjust the DO setpoint 
to control to an ammonia setpoint; therefore, while the traditional DO control system may fully nitrify influent ammonia to <0.2 mg/L, the ABAC 
will only nitrify to the Operators setpoint. Stoichiometrically, nitrification requires approximately 4.6 grams of oxygen to oxidize a gram of 
ammonia. This presents an opportunity to reduce the overall aeration demand and reduce energy consumption. ABACs has been shown to reduce 
aeration demands by 10 to 20% as compared to a traditional DO control system. Installation of the ABAC system is summarized in Exhibit 2.F.3 

EXHIBIT 2.F.3. SUMMARY OF STEPS FOR INSTALLATION OF THE ABAC SYSTEM TO IMPROVE BIOLOGICAL NUTRIENT REMOVAL 

Approach Rationale/Benefit 

Evaluate aeration system Evaluate the existing aeration to verify equipment condition and turn-down capability to develop 
alternatives to maximize potential savings. 

Rehabilitate aeration system Replace air mass flow meters and flow control valves for the diffuser grid drop legs (as identified in evaluation). 
Rehabilitation DO measurement system Replace DO probes and controllers (as identified in evaluation). 
Install ammonia measurement system Install new ammonia probes in the bioreactors and effluent ammonia analyzer in the secondary effluent. 
Provide additional control logic for ABAC The existing DO control system will require additional control logic for the ammonia-based control. 

Ammonia measurements and control setpoints will be provided in the SCADA system.

Performing a “Zero Tolerance” Odor and Noise Control Program 

Through your “Zero Tolerance” program, the City has gone to great lengths to successfully abate and manage noise and odor complaints that 
stem from the plant. In order to maintain the City’s high expectations in this endeavor, Jacobs will routinely monitor the plant for odors and 
noises including the presence of Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) using a portable H2S meter and a hand-held sound level meter. Operators will make 
routine patrols of the plant and the boundary using both the portable meters as well as their own senses to determine if noise, H2S or other 
odor conditions are detectable. Once per shift, Jacobs will make an off-site patrol to specified potential odor source locations in neighboring 
vicinities during the known high odor season using a portable H2S meter. Any detection of abnormal noise, odor or H2S will be cause for 
Jacobs to implement a corrective action plan. Written guidelines will be prepared for operators to follow if any of these three elements are 
detected. Jacobs will record each plant patrol finding, including any measured readings of noise, H2S or detection of odor on an Odor and 
Noise Inspection Log. Jacobs will sign the log for each patrol indicating time of patrol, weather conditions, wind speed and direction.  

There may be times when due to a combination of unfavorable meteorological conditions, equipment failures, or tank cleaning operations, 
odors or noise may travel past the fence line and may be detected by local residents. When this occurs, Jacobs will be immediately dispatched 
to the complaint location to interview the complainant and, if the odor and/or noise is still present, to record the intensity and character of the 
odor/noise, wind speed and direction, and other relevant information. Information requested from the complainant will include the following: 

 Frequency of odor/noise detection 

 Time of day when detected 

 Weather conditions when detected 

 Intensity of the odor/noise 

 Duration of odor/noise events 

This information will be kept in a permanent record per the plant’s air quality permit stipulations. Concurrently with the dispatching of an 
operator to the location of the odor and/or noise complaint, an immediate review of plant operations will commence. This review will consist 
of the analysis of the following elements: 

 Air handling building chemical scrubbers serving the influent 
pumping station, headworks, aerated grit tanks and primary 
settling tanks 
- Chemical scrubber serving the aeration basins 
- Chemical scrubber serving the sludge processing building 

 Sludge removal 
 Open hatches and doors 

 Septage deliveries 
 Duration of odor/noise events 
 Chemical feed system (ferrous chloride and potassium 

permanganate) 
- Noise levels emanating from all chemical scrubber 

discharge stacks 

 Low dissolved oxygen 

Operation staff will routinely check the blended sludge in the sludge building to ensure that sufficient potassium permanganate or other 
approved chemical is being added to the sludge to prevent the escape of H2S or other odors. Operators will check aeration tanks and 
secondary clarifiers for odor free conditions. They will also check the return sludge for the presence of any septic odors. The detection of any 
odors in secondary system will prompt operational changes such as increasing the air supply or the rate of return sludge. 

Routine housekeeping is an important yet simple way to ensure that odors do not escape from various locations on site. Operators will check 
the sludge processing building, the aeration basin facility and the headworks to ensure that doors are kept closed, exhaust systems are 
operating properly and that no abnormal amounts of dust or abnormal odors are present. They will check thickening and dewatering areas 
within buildings to ensure that H2S levels do not exceed safe levels for operational personnel. Safe levels within buildings for personnel 
should be low enough to preclude generation of objectionable odors that could extend beyond the facility fence line into the community. 

Odor Control Standards 

Jacobs will perform odor and dispersion modeling tests for the purpose of establishing the odor control baseline during the 
first contract year. Approximately every five years thereafter we will conduct sampling for and analyze the odor conditions at 
the plant in order to ensure that odor control is being optimally performed. The baseline odor tests will be performed only 

during periods when the treatment facility is being operated in compliance with the performance guarantees and there are no 
odor complaints that have not been resolved. This will ensure that baseline odor control standards are reflective of routine 

operating conditions. In addition, Jacobs will perform a wider, more comprehensive odor study that will include a wellness check on the existing 
chemical scrubbers and analyses of both odors released from the wastewater treatment plant itself as well as the conditions in the collection 
system lift stations lead to odorous compounds being brought to the plant through plant influent. Details on this wider approach are presented in 
the “Wellness Check and Baseline Odor Condition Establishment” section on the following page. 



 

  2-51 

In order to establish the baseline for odor control standards, the 
numerical H2S measurement and the dilution-to-threshold ratio will 
be reported for each wastewater treatment process. These values will 
then be used to determine a reasonable odor test-based numerical 
value to characterize the odors present at the listed locations during 
periods of normal, non-odor event causing operations and, as such, 
will become the numerical odor control standard.  

These results will then be input into our AEROMOD gaussian 
dispersion air model. The purpose of the use of this model will be 
to determine the extent beyond the plant fence line that foul air 
concentrations reach potential receptors at levels that are above 
the human detection limit and how many hours per year those 
concentrations would be expected at those locations. An 
example of graphical output from this model showing odor 
concentrations at various distances from a WWTF in California from 
one of our recent projects is presented in Exhibit 2.F.4.  

Such information will give the City a full understanding of the 
day-to-day impact, if any, that odors emanating from the plant are having on the surrounding neighbors. The beneficial impacts of any 
recommended odor control solutions will also be modeled using AEROMOD, thus giving the City further confidence that these solutions 
will have the desired effect of continuing to minimize odor impacts in the surrounding community. Jacobs will perform base line 
sampling and dispersion modeling every 5 years/  

Understanding of Odor Complaints and Odor Control Systems 

 Ferrous chloride is added to plant influent in order to precipitate existing 
dissolved sulfides from solution that are generated in the collection system 
and carried into the plant. The iron feed is employed during warm weather 
months when influent liquid phase dissolved sulfide and plant odors are 
expected to be higher than normal. Potassium permanganate is added 
occasionally to the blended sludge line in the sludge building to provide odor 
reduction in sludge processing. Vapor phase odor control is successfully 
performed by four (4) chemical scrubbers that range in airflow capacity from 
24,500 to 50,250 cfm. Elements of the system in the air handling building that 
control odors in the headworks are shown in Exhibit 2.F.5. The scrubbers utilize 
a combination of sodium hydroxide for pH control and sodium hypochlorite for 
oxidation of the vapor phase odorous compounds that are passed through the 
scrubber vessels.  

Wellness Check and Baseline Odor Conditions Establishment 

Given that the City In order to achieve this, during the first 
year of the O&M period Jacobs will perform an optimization-focused wellness check on the odor control protocols and 
facilities both at the water pollution control facility and at the 29 lift stations that directly contribute flows to the plant. 

At a minimum, odor sampling will also be conducted in the plant at the influent pumping station, headworks, aerated grit 
tanks and primary settling tanks. We will utilize the AEROMOD air dispersion model to determine the extent to which natural air 

dispersion of the treated air discharge from each of the four chemical scrubbers contributes to overall odor control beyond the fence line of 
the water pollution control facility. Such analysis will contribute to the optimized usage of chemicals in the four odor control scrubbers. For 
example, if analysis reveals that natural air dispersion contributes to a significant amount of odor reduction from these four treated air 
discharge points, it could mean that continued successful odor control could be achieved with less chemical usage in the scrubbers.

  2-52 

In addition to investigating the 
current physical and 
performance conditions of 
the chemical scrubbers, 

through a series of gas phase 
and liquid phase sampling and analysis 
procedures we will study the relationship 
between odorous liquid phase sulfide 
production in the collection system lift 
stations and subsequent chemical demand in 
the plant odor control chemical scrubbers 
with the goal of identifying opportunities to 
optimize potential combined odor control 
practices at the treatment facility and at the 
lift stations. For example, it could be that the 
most optimized odor control approach might 
include some combination of operation of the 
plant chemical scrubbers with less sodium 
hypochlorite and sodium hydroxide in 
conjunction with strategic liquid phase 
chemical feed at one or more of the collection 
system pump stations. This “ounce of prevention equals a pound of cure” approach in the collection system, combined with our AEROMOD-
driven analysis of dispersion of air discharges from the four plant chemical scrubbers could save the City up to hundreds of thousands of 
dollars in chemical costs per year if found to be feasible by our planned analytical approach. This optimization analysis will be greatly aided by 
our WATS collection system odor control dynamic computer model. An example of typical dissolved oxygen graphical output from the WATS 
model is presented in Exhibit 2.F.6.  

The WATS model utilizes GIS-based collection system physical information combined with flow data and grab sampling information to accurately 
predict, amongst many other odor-causing parameters, concentrations of liquid-phase dissolved sulfides in the collection system. As previously 
mentioned, the point of employing the WATS model for this application will be to expand upon our planned plant analysis to determine whether 
chemical feed might be more economically employed at one or more of the twenty-nine pump stations in the New Bedford wastewater collection 
system that currently contribute flows to it. The benefit of performing such an analysis would be to either confirm that current plant odor control 
practices are fully optimized or, if they are not, to identify additional methods by which such optimization could be achieved.  

Noise Control  

Jacobs’ capability includes acoustic prediction 
for new sites or for modifications to existing 
sites. Acoustic predictions are made using both 
in-house design tools, and the commercial 
software package SoundPLAN.  

When analyzing existing facilities, an important 
toolset is our ability to take onsite measurements 
of sound levels. This can include both indoor and 
exterior measurements of a building or facility. 
For industrial acoustics, Jacobs uses microphones 
to survey these facilities to find primary noise 
sources and their propagation around a facility. 
For example, a recent project utilized this 
capability to measure the sound levels of an 
operational agricultural processing plant and find 
the primary noise sources. These noise sources 
were going to be moved to a new building on 

EXHIBIT 2.F.6. TYPICAL GRAPHICAL OUTPUT FROM WATS MODEL 

 

EXHIBIT 2.F.7. ACOUSTIC MODEL FOR A RECENT INDUSTRIAL PROJECT 

 



 

  2-53 

another part of the property which was closer to the property boundary. Taking onsite measurements of the existing components allowed for more 
accurate modeling in the sound propagation analysis. The results of this analysis can be seen in Exhibit 2.F.7. 

Finally, as part of a typical acoustic analysis, noise mitigation techniques are provided to reduce or eliminate the potential of noise complaints 
or ordinance violations. It is sometimes necessary to isolate equipment in silencer housings or use barrier walls. Another useful method of 
noise mitigation is landscaping which can be useful along property lines or around parks to further reduce noise propagation. This 
combination of acoustic expertise at Jacobs allows us to provide valuable input in every phase of a facility’s life cycle, from design to 
operational maintenance or refurbishment. 

Our response to odor and noise complaints is discussed at that end of Section 2.E – Emergency Operations. 

G. Process Monitoring, QA/QC Reporting to City and 
Regulatory Agencies 

Jacobs is fully committed to delivering on the City’s objective of operating in full compliance with all 
applicable regulations, statutes, and permits.  

Jacobs will be responsible for regulatory fines or penalties assessed for noncompliance resulting from the negligent action of Jacobs during 
the contract term. Jacobs’ Environmental Compliance Program is an organized, systematic 
approach to maintain compliance with environmental, legal, and business requirements.  

Through nearly 1,000 project years (number of projects multiplied by average contract length 
served) Jacobs has achieved a 99.98-percent compliance record with all regulatory requirements 
and permit parameters. This figure is quite impressive considering the number and complexity of 
facilities that we manage. Utilizing a series of quality assurance/quality control procedures, we 
guarantee the integrity and accuracy of the compliance and facility-performance data that we 
gather and report to regulators. As a result, we have formed positive and beneficial working 
relationships with the agencies to which we report on behalf of our customers.  

Compliance Reporting Plan 

Jacobs will be responsible to perform all sampling, analysis and reporting as necessary for 
compliance with all current state and federal regulations and any permitting or other regulatory 
requirements. Jacobs will implement a comprehensive laboratory program at the New Bedford 
facility that is compliant with current and anticipated regulations, including 40 CFR Part 136, the 
EPA Method Update Rule (MUR), Standard Methods Online Version, Guidelines Establishing Test 
Procedures for the Analysis of Pollutants, and other industry-accepted standards.  

Jacobs will provide the City with a Quality Assurance Plan (QAP) detailing 
procedures for providing the City with timely regulatory and operational data. The QAP will also provide protocols for 

coordinating sampling activities with the City’s testing program and communicating regulatory issues with the City and 
regulatory agencies.  

A laboratory start-up will be performed that includes onsite training, installation of laboratory programs and policies, a review of regulatory 
requirements, and a follow-up laboratory review within 6 to 12 months. All resources will be utilized to make the laboratory compliant, 
efficient, and successful. Our main objective is to operate a fully-functional wastewater process control laboratory that will conduct all 
required sampling and analysis of samples in compliance with state and federal requirements. Compliant laboratory practices will be 
implemented and maintained along with an approved laboratory safety program.  

Routine analyses and procedures for NPDES reporting of field parameters such as pH and total residual chlorine are performed by the 
laboratory staff at the treatment facility. Additional permit-required analyses will be performed using a combination of both the in-house 
laboratory and commercial laboratories. Samples will be transported to the contract laboratories via courier service to ensure all samples 
meet hold time requirements. 



 

  2-54 

Permit Compliance Sampling Plan  

All samples will be collected, preserved, analyzed, and the results will be reported to meet all 
EPA and MA DEP regulatory requirements as specified in NPDES permit number MA0100781.  

Process Control Sampling and Testing  

In addition to permit-required compliance sampling, Jacobs will implement a Process Control 
Sampling Plan in order to monitor the condition and performance of individual unit processes 
within the New Bedford WWTF.  

Quality Assurance (QA) Protocols  

A Laboratory QA Program will be implemented to verify the reliability of the data produced in 
the New Bedford laboratory. This will safeguard against errors in data production by 
implementing testing protocols according to industry approved methods. The main objectives 
of Jacobs’ QA program are to produce reliable and defensible data, with documentation that 
fully complies with Massachusetts and Federal regulations. Jacobs’ QA program will utilize a 
suite of tools to ensure all required samples are collected and properly analyzed, data is 
traceable and verified, and that performance-bias is tested with blind proficiency evaluation 
studies.  

Quality Control (QC) Protocols  

QC requires technicians to essentially demonstrate that each day’s analysis was successful. All 
essential QC elements are incorporated with each method analyses, including, but not limited 
to: Method Blanks, Laboratory Control Samples, (LCS), Duplicates, Matrix Spike, and Matrix 
Spike Duplicate. Each essential QC element must meet the minimum EPA-established 
acceptable criteria for each analysis performed.  

Each Jacobs laboratory has required control limits for precision and accuracy that bracket the variation inherent in the test at that lab on our 
particular sample matrices. By using precision and accuracy control charts, Jacobs analysts can track trends and identify the emergence of 
systemic error. The graphs and charts necessary for these activities at the project site are prepared using our spreadsheet tool called “QC Stats.”  

Reporting Mechanisms  

Jacobs will maintain records and prepare reports to regulators and other project stakeholders (as appropriate), The type and frequency of 
reports that Jacobs will generate for the City will include Monthly Discharge Monitoring Reports. The NPDES Discharge Monitoring Report 
will be submitted on time as required each month. Per protocols agreed upon by the City, we will ensure that timely notification of permit 
violations and operational situations are made as appropriate. These types of notifications would cover laboratory results that indicate a 
permit violation, spills, and other situations that normally require notification of regulatory agencies.  

Laboratory Information Management System  

The City‘s laboratory data software programs that will be utilized by Jacobs are the HACH WIMS database and Microsoft Excel and Access. 
HACH WIMS is the primary database used for compiling permit and process laboratory data. The information is tracked, compared to historical 
averages and targets, and sent to our process supervisors to make any necessary changes at the facility. Our laboratories use a Document 
Control System to retain all original observations, calculations and derived data, and calibration records.  

Laboratory Operations Best Practices  

Jacobs is committed to managing the laboratory based on rigorous standards to ensure safety and equipment longevity. Our approach to 
laboratory safety involves implementing a site-specific laboratory safety plan, including a laboratory chemical hygiene plan (LCHP), chemical 
and safety training, and a focus on laboratory safety equipment. Jacobs’ works diligently to prolong equipment life and ensure proper 
operability by implementing a CMMS-based preventive maintenance plan for all critical laboratory equipment can be found in Section 6.E – 
Supplemental Information.

H. Licenses, Permits, and Approvals 
Obtaining Licenses 

Our commitment to excellence begins with our commitment to staff. 
We encourage and support our employees in pursuit of all applicable 
licenses—it’s part of our employee incentives program—and they 
appreciate our willingness to invest in their careers. Jacobs 
understands the importance of licensure is to the City of New 
Bedford and the State of Massachusetts, which is why our staffing 
plan ensures that properly licensed and certified personnel are on-
site to perform the required services at your facility.  

As indicated in Section 2-A, our leadership team possesses four 
Massachusetts wastewater operations certifications. One manager 
has applied for reciprocity and fully expects to have it well before the 
start of this partnership. For a complete list of the wastewater 
operator licenses held by our leadership team, please refer to the 
Proposer Qualifications Form in Section 5 – Proposal Forms.  

Obtaining Permits  

The single most important permit for this facility is the NPDES 
permit and its impacts on nitrogen, plant operations and any 
required upgrades to reduce nitrogen discharges. This permit will 
likely require additional reductions in the total nitrogen discharge 
within the next permitting cycle. We work proactively to make sure 
the appropriate agencies have everything they need when they need 
it. For the New Bedford permit, Permitting Lead Mike Wilson will 
meet early with regulators to start the submittal of applications in 
support of the regulatory approval and permitting process.  

Our philosophy for approvals centers on close coordination with 
regulatory agencies and timely permit negotiations and application 
submissions. When new permits are required, we build in the 
necessary review periods into the schedule. We facilitate 
completeness meetings to ensure application submittal packages 
contain all required material and are organized to the preferences of 
each agency. We conduct a full walk through of the package and 
identify any additional material needed. This proactive approach 
mitigates the agency’s need to request additional submittals during 
its scheduled review period and eliminates schedule delays.  

We also employ a proactive communications strategy from 
application preparation through final approval to keep the process 
moving. We will maintain a proactive communications approach 
after permit application submittal to effectively monitor the permit 
review and address questions and concerns. Jacobs’ permitting 
professionals will provide routine follow-up with each agency to 
maintain schedule requirements.

The proposer, Operations Management International Inc. (as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.), forms part of an 
organization that is comprised of approximately 450 operating companies and affiliates employing over 50,000 individuals with revenue of 
approximately $12.7B. Jacobs maintains a philosophy of working with clients, contractors, vendors and others to resolve disputes, whenever 
possible, without resorting to litigation. From time to time and in the ordinary course of its business, Jacobs may have been subject to claims, 
disputes, arbitrations, and other legal proceedings. The number of such instances in minimal; especially considering the nature of work and 
the size of the company. Jacobs considers its claims and related negotiations or resulting settlements to be confidential to the company and 
its clients. While the outcome of pending disputes is difficult to predict, senior management and General Counsel believe that no pending 
dispute, claim, arbitration or lawsuit will result in a material adverse impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements or its ability 
to perform its obligations under any contract.

A. Project Guarantor Commitment 
Jacobs will serve as the Project Guarantor and is a premier water business with the scale and experience needed to serve the growing water 
and wastewater needs of our clients. Our financial capacity and strong capitalization, combined with our resources as one of the country’s 
largest engineering, construction and operations firms, make it possible to successfully guarantee and deliver all aspects of the operations, 
maintenance, and management services of the New Bedford wastewater facilities. Jacobs demonstrates our willingness to execute the 
Schedule 3 Guarantee through the completion of Proposal Form 2 in Section 5 – Proposal Forms.  

B. Performance Bond/Letter of Credit Requirements 
Enclosed at the end of this section is the documentation for the performance bond for the base bid and each alternative. The 
documentation provides evidence that Proposer OMI will be able to annually renew the performance bond/letter of credit amounts during 
the term of the Agreement.  

C. Employee Transition Plan and Compensation Package 
Our proven transition approach is highly collaborative to ensure a seamless process that respects everyone 
involved and helps retain quality staff. A smooth transition is one of the first steps in a successful partnership 
with Jacobs and the transformation of the City’s operations to a high performing utility. As such, we invest 
significantly in the implementation of our systems, tools and processes, coupled by a strong focus on training 
and the development of our culture. 

The transition planning process will start immediately after notification of award to ensure 
subject matter experts and teams are organized, assembled and prepared to address all 
aspects of the transition on the contract date. A key aspect of our transition is to ensure full 
transparency through open and frequent communications with the City.  

Tapping into the Value of Existing Staff 

Jacobs values the existing employees and their institutional knowledge. We will offer 
qualified candidates competitive wages and benefits. Jacobs also understands the 
sensitivity of employees regarding transitioning and change and will provide informational 
sessions for employees and their families to better communicate our benefits package and 
transition processes. We routinely and successfully manage such transitions and will apply 
all our experience, qualified human resources, labor relations staff, and lessons learned to 
ensure the City’s transition is smooth and seamless. 

Should the City choose to include Alternatives 2 or 3 as part of Jacobs’ scope, we will work 
diligently to effectively integrate those current City employees who may join the Jacobs 
team into a cohesive team. Please see the details provided on our Section 2.C – Staffing 
Plan for our approach to staff management and building an effective team culture. 

Transition Team 

To ensure the success of this important partnership, we offer an onsite transition leadership team led by Regional Director and Transition 
Manager, Kevin Dahl, PE, as noted in Section 2.C – Staffing Plan. Kevin brings a long track record of smooth transitions, including Wilmington 
REBF in 2016 and Woonsocket. Team members who will be onsite part time up to 2 months (or May 1, 2020) prior to the Commencement 
Date include Transition Manager Kevin Dahl, Project Manager Mike Arnold, Operations Manager Adam Federau, and HR Manager Amy Reid, 
who will be onsite to complete the onboarding process of new employees and remain connected to the project as needed as the HR specialist. 
The remaining members of the team will join on the Commencement Date. 



 

  3-3 

Seasoned Experts Support Seamless Transition 

The Transition Team will work diligently with the existing staff who 
will transition to Jacobs to establish our onsite team. These 
seasoned experts, whose qualifications and team organization are 
summarized in Section 6.H – Supplemental Information, have 
successfully transitioned numerous O&M facilities and bring 
specific expertise in operations, maintenance, asset management, 
laboratory/sampling, safety, SCADA control, biosolids 
management, odor control, human resources, labor relations, and 
administration support.  

These assigned specialists will establish and implement our 
standard procedures, provide training to the new staff, and address 
proposed project-specific improvements. Transition team 
resources will remain available after the transition period for 
questions, training, follow-up assistance, and continued support to 
the onsite project staff.  

The Transition Team’s goals include: 

 Establish a formal communication and reporting protocol. 

 Ensure no deterioration in the quality of service during the 
transition. 

 Establish skills training needs assessments for project 
employees. 

 Introduce Jacobs’ business processes, the foundation for the implementation of industry best-practices. 

 Convey clear understanding of all contractual obligations to the extended transition and operations teams to ensure we are positioned 
to exceed the Commission’s expectations. 

 Keep all affected employees informed about the transition process at all times. 

Jacobs Transition Plan: Proven Strategy and Detailed Planning Ensures Orderly Operations Transition 

At the beginning of the transition period, we will review our proposed Transition Plan with the City and 
update it as needed, allowing us to immediately focus on our objectives while ensuring that the plan 
reflects the latest information, requirements and the City’s preferences. 

Upon contract execution, we will finalize all deliverables in accordance with the timing set forth in the 
agreement, begin the bulk of the initial information gathering, and start initiating the required O&M 
systems that must be operational upon contract start. All key staff will participate in transition activities so 
that everyone is familiar with the systems and tools being implemented, as well as with the City’s assets. 
At the same time, we will put in place all necessary programs related to laboratory practices and testing, 
regulatory notification and onsite communications plans, finalize all emergency response plans, and 
otherwise have all required notifications, communications and operational requirements fully functional 
by the commencement date.  

Throughout the transition period, all activities will be documented, minutes will be recorded from regular 
meetings with the City, and all required plans and documents will be logged to document completion of 
the various tasks. 

Through numerous successful transitions, Jacobs has crafted a proven checklist of Transition Schedule of Activities from Contract Award 
through 30 Days Post-Transition Start and an Action Plan for Organized and Timely Transition of Business Functions that we will review and 
tailor to the City’s preferences including: Administration, Purchasing, Health and Safety, Human Resources and Payroll, Asset Management, 



 

  3-4 

Performance of Processes, Process Control Laboratory, Information Technology (IT), and Business Management System (BMS). A detailed 
example Schedule and Action Plan are provided in Section 6.H – Supplemental Information.  

Thoughtful and Smooth Step-By-Step Transition Process for New Employees 

We understand that employee transitions can be stressful for a new workforce. We are fully committed to transitioning all existing 
qualified employees at the City’s facilities. We will implement a proven six-step process (Exhibit 3.4) to minimize stress and ensure a 
smooth workforce transition.  

EXHIBIT 3.4. JACOBS’ PROVEN TRANSITION PROCESS HELPS ADDRESS EMPLOYEE CONCERNS AND ENSURES SMOOTH TRANSFER OF 
WORKFORCE. 

 

Working collaboratively with the current O&M provider, we will build our team from existing employees and support them with resources 
drawn from within Jacobs. During the first days of the transition period, job descriptions will be refined after a needs-assessment for each 
position. A revised, in-depth list of skill sets will specify the ideal combination of experience and skills needed for each position. Needs 
assessments will be used in evaluating promotions, selecting candidates for hire, and developing training programs.  

Key Management Staff positions will be filled by Jacobs employees and may include qualified existing employee leadership as appropriate 
and valued by the City. All key staff will participate in transition activities so that everyone is familiar with the systems and tools being 
implemented, as well as with the City’s assets. At the same time, we will put in place all necessary programs related to laboratory practices 
and testing, regulatory notification and onsite communications plans, finalize all emergency response plans, and otherwise have all required 
notifications, communications and operational requirements fully functional by the commencement date. 

Compensation Package 

Jacobs recognizes the institutional knowledge and value existing staff bring to the project. We will offer all interested and eligible current WWTF 
employees (and City employees in the case of Alternatives 2 and 3) that want to come and work for Jacobs a comparable benefit package. 

D. Incentive Savings Programs 
Jacobs is confident that during this long-term partnership there will be instances—due to innovation and investment by 
either the City or Jacobs—that we will be able to perform the services of this contract more efficiently. We will work with the 

City to create an Incentive Savings Program (ISP) that allows for the recovery of the capital or investment while equitably 
adjusting the on-going services fee.  

Additionally, there are instances for which we, through Jacobs’ engineering and consultancy services, will offer programs 
that could result in efficiencies and/or lower O&M services. Our ISP will allow transparency and encourage innovation and 

enhancement during the life of this contract. Some of these programs are noted in our proposal. 

1) Air Modeling: During the first year of the O&M period Jacobs will perform an optimization-focused wellness check on the odor control 
protocols and facilities both at the water pollution control facility and at the twenty-nine lift stations that directly contribute flows to the 
plant. Such analysis will contribute to the optimized usage of chemicals in the four odor control scrubbers. The analysis could reveal that 
natural air dispersion contributes to a significant amount of odor reduction from these four treated air discharge points, it could mean 
that continued successful odor control could be achieved with less chemical usage in the scrubbers.  

2) WATS analysis: Optimization analysis of the odor control system will be greatly aided by our WATS collection system odor control 
dynamic computer model. Analysis and subsequent management of these upstream and downstream conditions will ensure that odor 
control operations for New Bedford are fully optimized and that the City’s zero tolerance odor control policy will continue to be 
successfully met.  



 

  3-5 

3) Energy audit both in terms of usage and rate:  
a) Based on careful review of the current electrical usage, Jacobs is offering a Guaranteed Maximum Electrical Usage ((GMEU) of 

11,000,000 kWh, which is below the current vendor's contractual GMEU. Additionally, blower optimization. Jacobs is confident 
that a tighter control logic system around DO and ammonia measurement and inlet guide vanes in the blowers for aeration tank 
system will enable a sizable drop in the blower output thereby reducing the electrical usage and maximizing the nitrogen 
reduction throughout the system. However, prior to implementing these changes, a more comprehensive hourly measurements of 
DO and ammonia is needed to accurately design the control logic. Jacobs plans to undertake this task within the first 120 days of 
the commencement.  

b) Competitive bidding of electrical rates has been successfully implemented for other clients we serve, with up to 35 percent annual 
savings and no capital investment. When combined with real time power usage monitoring, the City has the best tools available to 
optimize power cost. 

c) By using solar photovoltaic arrays there may be additional savings through solar renewable energy credits (SRECs) that are able to 
have paybacks of seven years or less. Jacobs has almost a dozen major PV arrays co-located at sites we manage for our clients. 

4) Chlorination and De-chlorination On-line Analyzer - A chlorination/de-chlorination real time controller would calculate the minimum 
amount of hypochlorite required in the front of the contact tank in real time to maintain the total residual chlorine set point at the end of 
the chlorine contact tank. This will result in improved and consistent effluent total residual chlorine concentration and a reduction of 
chlorine and bisulfite usage. 

5) Digital Twin for CSO monitoring: CSOs impact the water quality of the receiving stream. The amount of overflow from a CSO is a 
function of the characteristics of the area draining to the regulator and the rainfall received in this area. The operation of the system also 
can contribute to or reduce the amount of overflow. We propose, should the City accept, to develop a Digital Twin of the Collection 
System, including the regulators and CSOs and the WWTF. This Digital Twin will allow our team to develop an operational strategy with 
New Bedford that will be used to determine the existing operational strategy as an integrated system. Once this Existing Condition 
Digital Twin has been developed, our team will use this to develop an optimized operational overflow from the CSO. What this means to 
the City is a far more efficient management of the Nitrogen cycle because of control of the flow rate as well as reduction of electrical 
peak demand due to CSO.  

6) Financial Services - Jacobs can provide several specialized financial services to address immediate economic, facility condition, and 
financial questions, including identifying capital projects that qualify for grant and loan funding. For example, at our North Hudson 
project, working with our partners, we have successfully obtained over $20.5M in grant funding for the Sewage Authority.

MARK SMITH, PE | ODOR CONTROL LEAD

Profile 

Mark has significant experience with wastewater odor remediation, including directing numerous wastewater related odor analyses and 
solution implementation for zero tolerance odor control programs. This includes field monitoring for sewer ventilation and odor release 
conditions, comprising literally hundreds of miles of collection system piping and scores of WWTPs. He recently led a combined study of an 
applicably-sized collection system coupled with a study and design of corresponding odor control facilities at the treatment plant that treats 
flows from the collection system. For New Bedford, Mark will be responsible for leading both day-to-day and long-term studying and planning 
efforts for our proposed odor control strategy, both at the water pollution control facility and in the 29 pump stations in the wastewater 
collection system.

Relevant Project Experience 

Kellogg 25 MGD Water Resource Recovery Facility, Milwaukie, OR 

Client: Clackamas County Water Environment Services (WES) | Title: Senior Project Engineer for Odor Control 

Mark conceived and carried out odor sampling efforts at the plant during two successive summers at the 25 MGD water pollution control 
plant. Plant processes were identified and prioritized for numerous cost-effective odor control upgrades. In addition, several meetings were 
held with the local public advisory group and with representatives from the City of Milwaukie to extend the District’s good neighbor policies 
with these groups. As part of this effort, Mark set the design criteria for the planned replacement of odor control media in an 8,000 cfm in-
ground biological odor control facility. This effort was combined with a 6 month-long odor control study that Mark performed in the WES 
collection system that feeds the Kellogg treatment facility. The goal was to identify areas for optimization of odor control efforts in the 
collection system and at the plant. Such a study was made necessary due to the presence of 25 sanitary sewer lift stations throughout the 
collection system. The results of the study showed that WES was conducting odor control operations in the collection system in an optimized 
manner and that no further liquid phase odor control treatment was necessary upstream of the 25 MGD Kellogg plant. 

Wilsonville 4 MGD Wastewater Treatment Plant DBO, Wilsonville, OR 

Client: City of Wilsonville | Title: Senior Project Engineer for Odor Control 

Jacobs is the City’s DBO partner for the $36M upgrade and expansion project. The project expanded the WWTP’s capacity from 2.5 to 4 MGD, 
with future expansion capabilities to 7 MGD and produces Class A biosolids for land application. The project also replaced and upgraded most 
remaining portions of the original WWTP, which was first constructed in the early 1970s. Odor control was a key project driver, as the facility 
was previously faced with odor control issues that impacted the surrounding community. Jacobs’ design directs foul air from the fully enclosed 
headworks, bioreactor, and dewatering and drying building to a new engineered media biofilter. The revitalized facility produces a higher 
quality effluent and eliminated several odor generating processes. Mark reviewed odor control related reports and submittals during the 
upgrade of the WWTP that included a facility plan update, risk management evaluation, surveying and condition assessments, and also set the 
stage for subsequent conceptual design and establishment of performance criteria.  

Interceptor ATF Study, City of Los Angeles, California 

Client: City of Los Angeles | Title: Project Manager 

Phase I: The owner had been plagued by odor problems emanating from large diameter interceptors in Central Los Angeles since the 1920s, 
which had gone unsolved. Mark led a team of engineers who studied the problem in detail via a comprehensive continuous differential air 
pressure sampling effort. The recommendations from this study included setting the design criteria for three10,000 cfm odor control systems 
that were subsequently designed, built and are currently successfully reducing odorous emissions from the Central Los Angeles wastewater 
interceptor system. 

Phase II: The City of Los Angeles was under order to solve odor control problems in its large diameter wastewater outfall system. As technical 
lead on a subsequent study, Mark conceived, directed and carried out several baseline air pressure and forced ventilation air pressure 
monitoring tests on many large diameter outfall sewers throughout Greater Los Angeles. Two years’ worth of intensive field sampling and 
subsequent data analysis resulted in recommendations that saved the city millions of dollars in capital and O&M money by identifying flow 
diversion schemes and drop structure retrofits that significantly reduced the number of odor complaints. 

Kailua Regional 28 MGD WWTP TIPS and Headworks, Honolulu, HI 

Client: City and County of Honolulu | Title: Senior Project Engineer for Odor Control 

Mark performed pre-design and design services for two separate odor control facilities as part of this combined plant decommissioning and 
plant upgrade project. Biological odor control systems were designed both for a CSO storage tunnel at the decommissioned plant as well as 
for the Tunnel Influent Pump Station and headworks at the Kailua RWWTP. 

Budd Inlet 22 MGD WWTP Improvements, Olympia, WA 

Client: LOTT Clean Water Alliance | Title: Senior Project Engineer for Odor Control 

Mark performed pre-design services for scrubber system on plant upgrades and performed QC on subsequent design. The project consists of 
major upgrades to the biological nitrogen removal process, centrate treatment facilities, chemical feed facilities, odor control, energy 
conservation improvements, and rehabilitation of primary sedimentation facilities.

Jacobs Laboratory Management Program 

Methodology – The in-house process laboratory will follow the most current USEPA and Standard Methods of chemical analyses. Jacobs’ 
Compliance & Reporting (C&R) Team establishes site-specific laboratory procedures and SOPs and will train staff on pertinent topics including 
quality control, safety, sampling protocols, correct analytical methods and the most up-to-date approved test method to meet permit 
requirements. We will routinely analyze quality control samples using Method Blanks, Reference Standards, Duplicate Samples, Spiked 
Samples, and Split Sampling where applicable.  

Chain of Custody – Required for all outside and in-house process laboratory analyses, the chain of custody records the sample preservation 
and handling procedures for detailed tracking of samples. We will utilize an in-plant laboratory and operations logbook to further track the 
sequence from sample collection through final analyses for all process samples. We will comply with all chain of custody, preservation and 
transport requirements as defined by the City for all permit required analyses.  

Instrumentation – Laboratory equipment and plant meters, including in-line equipment, are calibrated to ensure accurate and precise 
analysis results. Calibration results are recorded in logbooks to meet regulatory requirements. When calibration results prove to be outside of 
operating specifications, our staff will perform necessary preventive and corrective maintenance. Annual third-party calibration procedures 
will be conducted to ensure compliance with industry standards for instrumentation. 

Our proven approach will be documented in Jacobs’ Quality Assurance Manual which will be customized for New Bedford. Our C&R Team performs 
regular internal audits of the laboratory and reporting procedures and will require analysis of blind audit samples at least twice a year. 

Elements of the LIMS System:

Example of Typical Jacobs’ 
Emergency Response Plan



 

  6-27 

F. Example of Typical Jacobs’ Emergency Response Plan 
The purpose of an Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan (ERP) is to prevent emergencies where possible, to prepare for emergencies 
that may occur and to provide clear, concise procedures following an emergency to resume normal operations as soon as possible. As an 
industry leader in emergency response and preparedness, Jacobs has access to nationally recognized experts who are skilled at helping local 
government officials and the public understand the risks posed by natural hazards, evaluating whether the level of risk is acceptable, and 
prioritizing mitigation actions. Our experts author technical guidance, emergency plans, training, and user manuals that emphasize 
quantitative hazard-level determinations, vulnerability and risk, and cost-effective mitigation strategies and action items. 

We will develop a customized ERP that incorporates our experience developing and implementing similar plans for facilities throughout the 
region, integrating design and operational considerations specific to the City’s facilities. The program team’s most important tasks during 
emergencies are to protect the safety of personnel and the public, reduce capital losses, and protect environmental quality surrounding the 
scene. Our plan includes preparing for and responding to a broad range of situations, as well as training personnel in procedures and 
appropriate use of emergency equipment. 

Plans also include critical coordination with the City and other agencies. 

Chemical Spills—Onsite and from Offsite Transportation 

All chemical spills are treated as an emergency situation requiring extreme caution and organized action. Individual material safety data 
sheets (MSDS) are used to determine proper cleanup and control measures. Records are retained with the following: 

 Type of chemical 
 Location of spill 
 Estimated volume of spill 
 Method of clean up 
 Personnel involved 
 Supervisor’s signature 

In the event of a large chemical spill, the local Fire Department and the Public Safety Department will be notified even if the situation appears 
to be under control to determine if assistance is needed. Spills of certain materials or specific volumes must be reported to MADEP and to the 
National Chemical Response Center. This information is included in all MSDS kept in the plant laboratory. 

Pipe, Valve, Pump, Equipment, and Process Failures 

To address piping, valve, pump, equipment, and process integrity risk, we will perform an assessment of these assets initially and then on an 
ongoing basis to minimize failures. Avoiding these risks has many benefits to employees, managers, operations staff, shareholders, and 
society as a whole, such as: 

 Increased safety 
 Reduced environmental risk 
 Increased uptime for operations 
 Reduced unplanned downtime and failures 
 More accurate data for the Integrity Management System 
 Overall reduced operating risk 

Failure Mode and Effect Analysis 

Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) is a methodical study of component failures. This review starts with a diagram of the operation and 
includes all components that could fail and conceivably affect the safety of the operation. Typical examples are instrument transmitters, 
controllers, valves, pumps, piping, rotometers, etc. These components are analyzed for the following: 

 Potential mode of failure (i.e., open, closed, on, off, leaks) 



 

  6-28 

 Consequence of the failure; effect on other components and effects on whole system 
 Hazard class (i.e., high, moderate, low) 
 Probability of failure 
 Detection methods 
 Remarks/compensating provisions 

Once the assessment is completed, critical equipment spares, such as pumps, valves, controllers and piping, will be placed in inventory so 
emergency replacements can be made expediently. Should the failure be process related (e.g., an upset at the treatment plant that is 
hydraulic or organic related), we will follow the steps outlined in the ERP to address the situation. 

Extended Downtime 

If the facility is impacted for an extended time, we will use practical approaches to determine the best course of action. First, we will notify the 
City promptly to discuss what the issue is and provide an estimate of how long the facility may be out of service. 

For situations that are only a few days up to a maximum of a week, our approach will be as follows: 

 Increase treatment plant solids retention time (SRT) and adjust aeration basis dissolved oxygen to hold inventory under aeration 
and minimize wasting. 

 Employ the use of chemicals to assist in improving solids captures in the primary clarifiers (chemically enhanced primary treatment 
[CEPT] system) to reduce the load on the aeration basin during this time and maximize the amount of storage and detention in the 
gravity thickeners. 

Situations 1 week or longer are considered extended periods, and our approach will be as follows: 

 Use CEPT as appropriate. 
 Where possible, coordinate with our local solids hauling vendors to dispose of the solids in a manner for beneficial reuse (i.e., land 

application, composting, or alternate daily cover for landfills). 

 Should the beneficial reuse option not be available, explore the most efficient option to dispose of solids at a landfill. 
 Review all options thoroughly and discus with the City prior to a decision being made. 

Power Failure 

In the event of a partial or complete power failure certain procedures are followed to minimize equipment downtime. The local power company 
will be immediately contacted when a power failure occurs. To determine the location of the outage, a complete list of all meter numbers for 
lift stations and other unit processes will be located at the operator desks and in the back of the onsite ERP. 

When power is interrupted for more than 15 seconds, the existing emergency generator will startup automatically. To ensure that the 
emergency generator operates properly, the generator is exercised weekly under the maintenance management program, and any required 
corrective maintenance identified is scheduled immediately. For the SCADA network and computers, an independent uninterruptible power 
supply (UPS) will be installed in all locations to ensure that the network is never without power. 

Fire 

In the event of a fire, we will take the following steps: 

 All personnel will promptly report the occurrence of any fire, no matter how small, to their immediate supervisor, Emergency 
Response Lead and the Safety Lead. 

 Notifications for fires will always include the following: 
- The City 
- Local Emergency Management and Emergency Coordination Center or other designated agency (911, contacts medical, 

fire, police responders as needed) 

- MADEP 



 

  6-29 

- Local electrical and natural gas providers (if a gas fire) 
- Other agencies as required 

 In the event of a minor fire, respond by extinguishing the fire with available fire extinguisher and/or water lines, assuming this can be 
done without risk of personal injury. 

 Should a major fire occur, promptly call 911 and immediately evacuate all personnel in the area in an orderly fashion. 
 Personnel are to report to muster areas. 
 All power and natural gas lines to area of fire are immediately turned off. 
 Supervisors conduct head counts at muster areas and ensure that all staff are present. They will notify the Safety Lead and 

Emergency Response Lead of the counts. 

Earthquakes and Floods 

The Safety Supervisor will monitor emergency broadcasts and communicate to the Project Manager, Superintendent of Facility Operations, 
and others to ensure proper preparation for such events. In the event of an earthquake or flood, the highest priority is public and employee 
safety during and after the event. Posted instructions for these events will include the following: 

 Take cover to protect yourself from injury by getting to a safe area. Safe areas include doorways, under doorsills, or beside heavy 
upright beams. If those areas are not available or accessible, get under the nearest heavy table, desk, bench, or machine. 

 If there is overhead glass in the area, keep a jacket nearby to cover yourself from falling debris. 
 Look around for equipment that may fall or tip over in the area and stay clear. 
 Do not run from buildings during an earthquake. Most injuries occur outside from flying debris, falling objects, or from downed high-

voltage wires. 

 Avoid elevators and extinguish open flames. If you are at a location that has an elevator, do not use it during an emergency. 
 Do not smoke or light a match/lighter, as there may be ruptured gas lines. 
 Once the initial shock is over, calmly walk out of the building to the site Evacuation Area. Do not reenter the building until the 

structural damage has been assessed. 

Flooding can occur as a result of either long-term, sustained precipitation; short-term, intense weather events; or a rupture in pipes. 
Procedures specific for flood events include the following: 

 Install stop logs  
 Secure work area and turn off equipment and machines, if feasible. 
 Evacuate the site if conditions permit. 
 If unable to evacuate, move personnel to higher grounds. 
 Ensure the safety of personnel. 

Freezing Weather 

Occasionally weather conditions will be so severe that freezing may cause equipment failure or create unsafe conditions for plant personnel. 
Preventive measures are taken to keep equipment online and flows unrestricted through the plant. When low temperatures cause icing, 
associates will do the following: 

 Shut off spray equipment to reduce surface icing. 
 Keep all clarifier drive mechanisms online as long as possible; when ice loads become heavy and torque overloads are activated, do 

no reset. 

Before freezing temperatures arrive, crack open hose bibs and hydrants and cover exposed piping. If hydrants or hose bib pipes break causing 
minor flooding, shut down water to that area when possible. If it is not possible, clearly mark hazard and inform the supervisor. 



 

  6-30 

Lightning 

The most serious lightning damage would be from a direct strike on the telemetry system, emergency generator, plant equipment, or lift 
station. A direct strike would impair the level of treatment or possibly contaminate the environment. Remedial action would depend on which 
components were shut down, and would primarily involve immediate repairs of all electrical damage so that normal operations could resume 
as quickly as possible. In the event bad lightning or severe weather is approaching, safety precautions include the following: 

 Shut down and unplug plant computers. 
 Secure doors and loose equipment. 
 Seek shelter away from windows, doors, and metal objects that may act as a ground. 
 Avoid standing in water. 

If plant is struck by lightning, associates will immediately contact their Supervisor. Field personnel will take shelter in a vehicle or building 
until the threat of lightning has passed. 

Influent Wastewater Quality and/or Quantity Outside Specifications 

Should influent wastewater quality or quantity be outside of specifications, and regardless of whether it is categorized as an upset or not, we 
will evaluate the particular situation and make the appropriate process control adjustments to maximize plant performance and minimize the 
risk for any effluent water quality issues. Once adequate information is generated, a description of the incident and its cause will be 
communicated and include: 

 The period in which influent was outside of specifications, including exact dates and times. 
 The estimated time the out of specification situation is expected to continue if it has not been corrected. 
 Discussion with the City on steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the out of specification situation. 

In either upset situation or not upset situation, we will communicate promptly with the City to discuss the occurrence even if all information 
isn’t known at the time to capture all data known and identify what needs to be examined. We will provide periodic updates as appropriate to 
ensure the City is well informed. 

In the event that influent water quality or quantity is outside of specification and warrants notification to MADEP, we will inform the City prior 
to making any notification. 

Proposer-Operated Pump Station Failures and Overflow 

Responsibility for operating and maintaining the City’s designated pump stations is critical to the success of this partnership. Taking a 
proactive approach is the most important factor when it comes to preventing pump station failures and overflows. We will use our MMS to 
ensure that stations are checked and maintained to a high-quality standard for preventative and predictive maintenance procedures. Each 
station will be loaded into MMS where station checks and maintenance will be documented and tracked. As previously noted, pump station 
equipment that is deemed critical will have spares in inventory so situations involving equipment failure can be responded to and mitigated 
quickly. Our proactive Maintenance Management and Asset Management Program will also minimize likelihood of failure. 

In the unlikely event that a pump station failure should occur and an overflow condition exist, the City will be contacted first as soon as 
conditions permit. Under these circumstances: 

 Immediate emergency response actions are required at the sewer interceptor pump stations and assistance as-needed. 
 Immediate emergency response actions are required at the sewer collection system. 
 Immediate emergency that may impact City-operated utilities (collection and pumping of wastewater). operations or threatens 

human health or safety of City Utilities Operations staff. 

 During normal working hours, City Wastewater Utilities will be contacted at the Wastewater Department; after hours, City dispatch 
will contact the appropriate City staff as listed in draft ERP. 

We will follow the prescribed emergency response procedures for spills and clean up to ensure that any overflow is contained as much as 
possible and to minimize any threat to the public or environment. Jacobs and the City must also provide MADEP with a written submission 
within 24 hours of an overflow condition occurrence. The written submission must contain the following: 



 

  6-31 

 Description of the noncompliance and its cause 
 Period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times 
 Estimated time noncompliance is expected to continue if it has not been corrected 
 Steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance 

Emergency Telephone Numbers 

A comprehensive and up-to-date emergency contact list provides information needed for all workers to address emergency and emergent 
situations quickly. An emergency contact list with site numbers will be posted at each worksite and include the following: 

 Project contacts, including Project Manager, Safety Director, and Site Supervisor 
 City of New Bedford Public Safety Department 
 Police, Fire, and Ambulance for surrounding communities— emergency (911) and non-emergency numbers 
 Area hospitals 
 MADEP 
 Serious Incident Reporting and Crisis Management 

Emergency Equipment Inventory 

As mentioned in the sections for Pipe, Valve, Pump, Equipment, and Process Failures, Jacobs will use an analysis approach of all equipment up 
to and including spare parts inventories and develop a detailed and comprehensive list for critical equipment and spares and will be analyzed 
for the following: 

 Potential mode of failure (i.e., open, closed, on, off, leaks) 
 Consequence of the failure; effect on other components and effects on whole system 
 Hazard class (i.e., high, moderate, low) 
 Probability of failure 
 Detection methods 
 Remarks/compensating provisions 

In the event that emergency equipment is a rental item or provided as a specialty service by a vendor, those agreements for 24/7 service will 
be developed and put in place in advance so there will be no interruption in service. 

Coordinating with Public Safety Agencies 

Jacobs works closely in partnership with agencies that place a priority on public safety and our approach is to meet with such agencies 
frequently to familiarize ourselves with their procedures, as well as educate them on the treatment facilities. Notification requirements, 
depending on the situation, shall include City Utilities, County Office of Emergency Services, State Office of Emergency Services, Public Health, 
Sheriff, and Fire and Police Departments. As described in the ERP, other local, state, and federal agencies will be notified of any activity, 
problem, or circumstance that threatens the safety, health, or welfare of the facility staff or City residents. 

Evacuation Drills 

We will conduct at least one evacuation drill per year. The drill will cover all site locations, buildings and shifts. The local Fire Department will 
be invited to participate to become familiar with the site and be more prepared in the event of an actual emergency. 

Conducting an evacuation drill involves the following: 

 Plan the drill and enter the event 
 Conduct or simulate the drill 
 Verify the appropriate evacuation takes place 
 Time the evacuation 



 

  6-32 

 Check the site for people who did not leave, areas where the alarm can’t be heard, or other potential problems 
 Give employees the OK to come back inside 
 Critique the drill 
 Document the critique, communicate results with employees, and discuss any improvements to address 

Emergency Preparation and Prevention 

Most emergency situations occur suddenly and without warning. The best way to minimize the impact of any emergency on employees, 
equipment and the environment is to plan ahead and train all associates on how to respond in case of an emergency situation. For situations 
where advanced warning is possible (i.e., floods, freezing) planning must include actions to be taken immediately before these events are 
expected to occur. Our planning approach includes: 

 Pre-disaster planning workshops 
 Documentation of requirements and procedures 
 Identify resources available to the Jacobs emergency response team 
 Prioritization of critical governmental operations 
 Development of scalable, before-, during- and after-event response implementation procedures 

Proven Rapid Response Capability & Resource Depth 

We recognize your service provider must be able to respond quickly and efficiently to emergencies. With a staff of more than 2,300 in the 
Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, Jacobs’ trained personnel can respond quickly to any emergency, supporting our onsite team or the City within a 
matter of hours. 

To achieve the highest level of responsiveness and ease of access to our temporary personnel and equipment resources in time of need, we 
have organized our multifaceted team and approach to provide Gresham the following customized plans and resources: 

 Contingency and emergency response plans 
 Identification of local and regional emergency response resources 
 Continuity of operations planning 
 Access to FEMA certified respondents 
 Access to NIMS implementation support applications 
 FEMA public-assistance coordination 
 Disaster recovery & restoration 

Jacobs’ proven FEMA-endorsed approach addresses all aspects of disaster preparedness, disaster restoration, FEMA public-assistance 
coordination, and disaster recovery.

G. Example of Typical Jacobs’ Staffing Plan Elements 
Developing a High-functioning Team 

Long-term effective and efficient operations will require not only a technically sound operational strategy, but also a staff that understands 
the principles of treatment and is organized and led in a way that it applies that understanding in changing conditions. In short, a reliable 
operation and the ability to optimize it, require a high level of staff development.  

Culture 

“Culture” is not a mysterious or a fad-driven feature of a workplace. Every workplace has one; it is a matter of whether it is a healthy one. The 
philosophy of a Jacobs operation is this: it must “work in 360 degrees.” This means: 

 We produce clean effluent that protects the environment.  
 We provide value to the City—in efficient operations, protection of your assets, and by providing sound science-based information 

for your use in decision making. 

 We create a workplace where staff can apply and grow their abilities.  

Team Meetings 

Regular operations meetings or full staff meetings provide opportunity for leadership to convey themes to staff and to disseminate 
information. It is a time to conduct staff-wide training, coordinate work (such as between maintenance and operations), raise issues, and 
celebrate accomplishments. And, these meetings also establish a sense among staff of being a member of a group with a purpose.  

In a functional staff, meetings are not rote. Any staff member may be responsible for preparing content since all are assigned responsibility for 
parts of the plant operation and depend on others for its implementation. Operators evaluate process status against targets and determine 
appropriate adjustments. A typical operations meeting will include projection of graphs representing process performance data. For example, 
energy and chemical consumption is among the data reviewed together. Operators can see changes in energy use each week and correlate it 
with recent operational decisions.  

Professional Development  

A functional staff is made up of people who are actively improving themselves. Employees and supervisors think about and discuss directions 
of development that work both for the individual and the organization. Mechanisms for encouraging and guiding development will be part of 
work lives. These include regular employee/ supervisor communication and formal goal setting. Employees are encouraged and supported in 
pursuit of licensure.  

Training  

This topic is introduced in the Professional Development/Training section of Section 2.C – Staffing Plan.  

Ongoing Targeted Training and Knowledge Retention  

Jacobs will provide focused training, based on employee 
assessments and identified needs, throughout the life of the 
project. Typical training topics are show in Exhibit 6.G.1. 

We have deployed various training systems at more than 
200 O&M sites, providing more than 50,000 hours of 
training to staff across North America. We will leverage 
this extensive training experience when developing a 
staff development program for the City of New Bedford.

Structured Training Approaches 

Our structured training approaches, summarized in Exhibit 6.G.2 are focused on helping employees and the project accomplish their specific 
skill enhancement goals. Retention of newly learned skills requires applied training materials customized to the participant’s work 
environment and coupled with post-class assignments—all designed to help the participant apply what they have learned at the point of work. 
To encourage success, coaches are assigned to make sure the participants understand and can successfully apply what they have learned, 
enabling them to work safely and effectively. We will provide the City with an annual training report each January, documenting the past year’s 
training results and a schedule for the upcoming training year. 



 

  6-35 

EXHIBIT 6.G.2. TARGETED TRAINING APPROACH 

Targeted Training Type Description 

Transition and New 
Employees 

Initial training and development encompass health and safety (H&S), operations/technical and administrative procedures, 
quality management, certification, and other courses designed to improve skills. 

Ongoing Training Required for all projects, ongoing training ensures that staff members understand the processes in place to ensure 
compliance. Each associate receives training on NPDES permits, the sampling plan, the O&M Plan, emergency response 
plans, and others. Annual training is provided on project standard operating procedures (SOPs), unit process control plans 
(UPCPs) and maintenance procedures. Training on contract compliance will include key project indicators (KPIs), 
deliverables, CMMS audits and other contract requirements. 

Quality Coaching An element of Jacobs’ quality management program. Trained quality coaches deliver focused training on a variety of topics, 
including statistical process control, communications, leadership, time management, and other topics. Mental Health 
training has been incorporated and each project now has a mental health champion. 

Certified Maintenance 
and Reliability 
Technician Program 

These certifications reinforce the philosophy of reliability-centered maintenance, which is the gold standard for overall 
plant performance. A progressive knowledge base ensures that our staff are performing in accordance with best practices 
and maximizing the life of the New Bedford WWTP assets. 

 

Jacobs University Jacobs uses its own best practice instructional design and on-line courses to provide training to the work teams in a series of 
areas relevant to the project. Management staff will receive management and administrative training via a 40-hour 
leadership training program and annual ethics training. We will work with City to develop a framework for how the Jacobs 
University approach could be applied to the City’s training program and assist with implementation. Subjects can range from 
job-related skills and operator training to management skills such as efficient team management, creative solution 
development, and performance management. 

 

Improved Certification of All Staff Assigned to the Project  

Jacobs encourages advancement in certification by awarding staff with a cash bonus for each increase in certification. Jacobs is also taking our 
maintenance staff to the next level by driving certifications around the Certified Maintenance Reliability Technician (CMRT) provided by the 
Society of Maintenance and Reliability Professionals (SMRP) and Certified Reliability Leader (CRL) provided by the Association of Asset 
Management Professionals (AMP).

predictive maintenance tools that should be considered are: 
- Detailed inspections 
- Vibration monitoring 
- Infrared thermography 

- Oil and fluid analysis 
- Ultrasonic inspection 
- Motor circuit and motor performance analysis 

 Activities related to employee skills and training are a vital part of asset management and include: 

 Interviewing all maintenance personnel to determine whether they are adequately trained, determining whether they have any concerns about the 
condition of the facilities, and obtaining details of historical maintenance gaps. All maintenance employees should have enough training on the 
CMMS to be able to review equipment history data and preventive maintenance tasks. At a minimum, the plant should have a procedure in place 
that would allow the maintenance personnel to get this information from another employee or manager. 

 Ensuring that all maintenance personnel have knowledge of predictive maintenance tools. 
 Ensuring that employees who perform mechanical repairs are properly trained. 
 Ensuring that relevant employees have the necessary training to properly align motors. 
 Ensuring that employees whose jobs require them to work on electrical circuits have adequate electrical training and are properly licensed or

  6-43 

I. Example of Jacobs’ Health, Safety and Security Plans 
Health and Safety (H&S) Plan 

Employees taking ownership of the H&S program is critical in achieving zero accidents. Jacobs, Regional Director Kevin Dahl and Project 
Manager Mike Arnold are accountable for protecting the environment, safety and health of every worker and the public by identifying, 
analyzing and mitigating hazards and implementing effective work practices. Employees have the right and responsibility to report unsafe 
acts, conditions, areas of concern and to interrupt or stop work without fear of reprisal. No employee will be asked to complete a task that the 
employee feels is unsafe or may endanger the environment. We will not compromise safety for the sake of any other objective. 

Jacobs has the following responsibilities to its employees. First, the responsibility to involve all employees in the task or job, including the 
planning, identification of the hazards, pre-job hazard briefings, and all aspects of the task or job performance. Management is held 
accountable to ensure that all employees are involved in each aspect of the job or task at hand. 

Management shall ensure that all work is performed within the controls that have been identified and to continually review the job for any new 
hazards. Management will also ensure that only qualified and appropriately trained personnel are allowed to perform any job or task. The 
responsibilities of the H&S staff are to review implementation of the safety program, provide guidance on the selection and use of safe work 
practices, and to help identify, analyze, and mitigate hazards. 

H&S Training 

Immediately upon joining Jacobs, employees participate in an orientation to our safety program, during which they learn about the policies and 
procedures outlined in our Accident Prevention Plan (APP). We have over 100 online safety courses that allows our employees to continue 
required training without disrupting operations. We also maintain a library of classroom and practical based safety training programs, some of 
which are designed to meet specific OSHA regulations. Examples of courses include: hazard communication, hazardous waste operations, confined 
space entry, bloodborne pathogens, lead, benzene, lockout/tagout, working from heights, personal protective equipment, and electrical safety. 
Prior to performing high-risk tasks, our safety team conducts classroom/practical training (NFPA 70E, CSE, Fall Protection, etc.).  

We also provide OSHA 30-Hour Construction and General Industry and construction and industrial safety awareness training that exceed the 
regulatory requirements. Jacobs has a number of medical surveillance programs that meet OSHA requirements as well, including hazardous 
waste operations, benzene, lead, and respiratory protection. We maintain a database that tracks employees who have received medical 
monitoring and who require additional examinations. 

Jacobs’ H&S program incorporates several different plans, all of which will be developed and implemented at the City’s facilities. 

 Safety Management Standards/Standards of Practice (SMSs/SOPs) – We maintain over 85 SMSs/SOPs that outline our 
comprehensive H&S requirements, including procedures for hazardous waste operations, written hazard communication program, etc. 

 Office Safety Programs – We have established office safety programs to prompt H&S in the office environment and to address 
employees’ safety concerns for all business operations. Central to the office safety programs are the office safety committees that 
are responsible for developing and implementing emergency planning and response procedures, identifying office safety hazards, 
and increasing safety awareness 

 Accident Prevention Plan – We require written site-specific APP’s for all field projects. 
 Competent Persons – We have a program for providing competent persons, either through their own or subcontractor personnel, as 

required by OSHA. 

 Inspections – We provide job site inspections consisting of both self-assessments and third-party audits. 
 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) – We provide employees with PPEs as required by the activities they are conducting. 
 Subcontractor Management – We developed the following systematic method for managing risks associated with subcontractors’ H&S: 

- Contract language that assigns the responsibility for safety to the appropriate party and outlines expectations associated 
with safety. 

- Prequalification of subcontractors based on their safety performance. The criteria used include EMR, OSHA statistics (i.e., 
incident rate, lost workday case rate), training, and written safety program. 



 

  6-44 

- Based on our relationship, subcontractors may be required to submit safety documents to demonstrate they are in 
compliance with appropriate regulations and are capable of managing their safety risks. 

Accident Prevention Plan (APP) 

The APP is the guiding document for each project and includes OSHA and client required site-specific written programs such as site emergency 
plans, confined space entry programs, hot work programs, etc. In addition, the written programs address site- specific OSHA and client training 
requirements such as hazard communication and fall protection. Incorporated areas include: 

 H&S Policy 
 Responsibilities and Lines of Authority 
 Management of Contractors and Suppliers 
 Training Requirements 
 H&S Inspections 
 H&S Expectations and Compliance 
 Incident Reporting 
 Plans, Programs, and Procedures 
 Forms and Permits 

Behavior Based Safety 

We will implement a Behavior Based Safety (BBS) approach that is designed to supplement the implementation of the APP for the project. The 
H&S Manager orchestrates the elements of the BBS that are applied to the project. These elements are determined based on client requirements, 
risk and project culture. We will verify compliance with the H&S program through routine self-assessments by the site H&S staff and project 
leaders. We also utilize scheduled corporate H&S audits by the Regional H&S Manager. Results of self-assessments and audits are provided to 
Project Manager Mike Arnold, who will take immediate action to correct deficiencies. Dennis is also responsible for tracking all audit findings to 
completion and documenting that the corrective actions are completed. Results of corporate audits are forwarded to Regional and Project 
Management, as well as the Corporate Director of H&S. These worksite analysis actions apply to office and field situations. 

In addition to auditing and the Safety Scorecard mentioned previously, we use the following lagging metrics to measure the effectiveness of 
our health and safety program: 

 OSHA Citations 
 OSHA Monetary Penalties 
 Lost Workday Case Rate 
 Lost Workday Rate 
 Average Lost Workdays Per Case 
 Restricted Workday Case Rate 
 Fatalities 
 Workers Compensation Experience Modification Rating 
 Workers Compensation Claims 
 Workers Compensation Paid 

BBS utilizes the principle of Plan, Do, Check, Act and this concept is documented and implemented through the Work Control Plan. The Work 
Control Plan is a part of the overall APP for the project. The concept includes properly planning each task, doing the work in a compliant manner 
with the plan, evaluating the task after completion to see if improvements are possible and acting on feedback from the check process. 

Annual Audits 

The City’s facilities will be audited at least annually by the Regional H&S Manager. The audit assesses the following major components: 

 Management Engagement 
 Planning of work 



 

  6-45 

 Recordkeeping and maintenance of written programs and plans 
- Accident Prevention Plans 
- Work Control Plans 
- Activity Hazard Analyses 
- Hazard Communication Program 
- Confined Space Entry Program 
- Lockout/Tagout Program 
- Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Hazard Assessments 

 Training assessments 
 Site physical conditions such as electrical safety, machine guarding, life safety, and housekeeping 
 Site work practices such as confined space entry, fall protection, NFPA 70E compliance and work practices, equipment operation, 

chemical handling, and PPE usage 

Weekly Inspections 

We will conduct weekly job site safety inspections. These are a management responsibility. Each department is required to inspect work areas 
and identify unsafe conditions or regulatory non-compliance. 

Equipment Inspections (Maintenance Connection and Other Tools) 

We will generate Work Orders for the inspection of H&S equipment such as eye wash stations, fire extinguishers, confined space monitoring 
meters, emergency lighting and exit signs. These items are incorporated into Maintenance Connection and other preventative maintenance 
software to ensure that the inspections are scheduled and completed in a timely manner. 

Activity Hazard Analysis 

Jacobs takes as many precautions as necessary to keep our employees safe. In addition to preparing SOPs for operating system equipment, the 
project team is required to perform an Activity Hazard Analysis (AHA) for all high hazard tasks. 

The AHA carefully studies and records each step of a job that employees perform, identifying existing or potential equipment, environment, or 
action-generated hazards. A complete and thorough AHA entails four essential steps: 

1) Analyzing, assessing, and evaluating a job. 
2) Breaking the job down into discrete steps. 
3) Identifying hazards, unsafe conditions, and unsafe work practices associated with the job. 
4) Identifying the correct way to perform the job. 

Creating AHAs will not eliminate risk completely but will confirm that tasks performed are less likely to result in injury or illness. 

Pre-Task Plans 

Prior to performing work, a Pre-Task Plan is completed and signed by each employee. This ensures that they have reviewed the AHA or Hazard 
Analysis and have all the PPE, tools and equipment required to perform the task safely. 

Health and Safety Training Database 

Jacobs developed a Health and Safety Training database (HandS) that is used to assess the training needs for each worker. The HandS system 
provides real-time data used to track and ensure that each employee has received the required training. Employees and supervisors receive 
notices in advance of training expiration dates. In addition to tracking training requirements, HandS is also used to track medical surveillance 
where required, audiometric testing, and respirator fit testing. 

Safety Scorecard 

Jacobs believes that we can only improve on what is measured. Therefore, we have created a Safety Scorecard that holds all levels of 
management accountable for the project safety.  



 

  6-46 

Since its inception, we have experienced lower incident rates and higher morale. The Scorecard is comprised of 2 lagging indicators and 8 
leading indicators (listed below). We believe that if the project focusses on each of the leading indicators it will ultimately reduce our 
recordables and motor vehicle accidents. The following summarizes the Scorecard leading indicators that are used for assessment: 

 Required training completion performance 
 Completion of Safe Observation Reports 
 Performance on scored HSE audits 
 Weekly Health and Safety Inspections of the site 
 Timely completion of Corrective Actions identified in HSE 
 Audits and Weekly Inspections 
 Health and Safety Prequalification of subcontractors 
 Timely submittal of incident investigation documentation 
 Timely reporting of injury incidents to the Occupational Health Case Management nurse 

Safe Observation Reports 

Jacobs utilizes a Safe Observation Report (SOR) system that requires managers and supervisors to regularly observe work as it is being 
conducted at the City’s facilities. This provides the opportunity for positive reinforcement of good work practices as well as coaching 
opportunities where improvements may be made. The observation also requires an evaluation of the pre-task plan/hazard analysis to 
determine whether it was adequate and is being implemented. Besides addressing behavior, SORs provide an opportunity to identify and 
correct site physical and health hazards. The results are tracked in a computer-based system, which generates trending reports. The trending 
reports allow the team to identify areas for focused improvement. 

Rewards and Recognition 

Another tool that Jacobs utilizes to support exceptional health and safety performance is the Rewards and Recognition system. This system is 
used to recognize any team member for exceptional H&S performance in terms of leading indicators, safety suggestions and improvements, 
and contribution. 

Nominations can be made by any employee and the recognition may range from Certificates of Recognition/Achievement, plaques, and 
monetary rewards. 

Security Plan 

The major components of Jacobs’ Security Program typically include the following components: 

Security Awareness and Training Security awareness training. Periodic refresher sessions will be required throughout the duration of the project. 

Security Incident Reporting 
All security and asset protection violations or concerns are reported immediately to the project manager. Security 
incidents such as theft, property damage, vandalism, and losses are recorded and investigations assigned. 

Security Surveillance 
Determine the appropriate physical security measures to mitigate any identified risk/threat or vulnerability at the 
New Bedford WWTP. During normal hours, the project offices will be secured. 

Information Protection 
Implement policies consistent with SCADA/IT standards provided by the City. Implement policies consistent with 
Jacobs SCADA/IT standards. 

General Security 
Zero tolerance policy for work place violence. Each employee has an obligation to report any observance or threat 
of violence in the workplace to safeguard an employee’s, property, and reputation. Maintain a drug- and alcohol-
free workplace. 

Security Assessments  Project manager will conduct an annual physical security/asset protection assessment. 

 



 

  6-47 

Cybersecurity 

Having a comprehensive ICS program is mandatory for today’s critical infrastructure operations. There is substantial pressure and momentum 
to force cybersecurity regulation in the water sector. Jacobs is leading the industry with expertise and evaluations that follow industry best 
practice NIST SP-800 standards and include: 

 Developing comprehensive SCADA Standards to include HMI, PAC, Network and Control Panel standards. 
 Conducting system wide ICS network architecture design, including detailed design with equipment specification for each facility or 

facility type. 

 Conducting RAMCAP J100 All Hazards assessment.  
 Developing ICS specific cybersecurity policies and procedures. These constitute approximately 80% of cybersecurity.  
 Developing Backup/Disaster Recovery and Response Plan along with Business (Ops) Continuity Plan.  
 Performing physical network design, including physical connectivity (fiber and copper) and physical location of equipment as well as 

physical security of equipment. 

 Performing logical network design that utilizes NIST recommendations for redundancy and industry best practice for network topology.  
 Performing WAN communications review to evaluate WAN system components, architecture and configurations of radio equipment, 

with a focus on identifying single points of failure, developing options for SCADA isolation, and performing penetration testing of 
WAN network. 

In addition to providing expert consulting, we also manage IT systems for sites where we are the contract operator, so we can offer suggestions 
regarding integration of CMMS, GIS, customer billing, financial data, and other software tools for an efficient operation, with a particular focus 
on needs from the various IT tools and systems.
