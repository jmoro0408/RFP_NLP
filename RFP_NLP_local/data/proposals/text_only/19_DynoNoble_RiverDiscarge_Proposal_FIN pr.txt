Firm Qualifications   Jacobs Engineering Group joined forces with CH2M HILL, an   Oregon-grown firm, in 2017. For 71 years, CH2M had   provided local agencies and companies with a full range of   consulting services—from early planning through final   design and construction. Now, with the merger of our two   companies, we offer an even deeper bench that is   unparalleled in the industry. Jacobs-CH2M has more than   1,300 employees in our Pacific Northwest offices and about   81,000 employees worldwide. Our proposed project team for   Dyno Nobel is in the Oregon/Washington area, with many years   of local knowledge and experience as industry leaders in the field of   wastewater treatment technology, design, and improvements.    The Jacobs team is well-versed on partnering with public and private clients to   tackle the world’s most complex infrastructure and natural resource challenges.   Our work is concentrated in the water, transportation, energy, environment, and   industrial markets.   Jacobs has extensive experience with designing and permitting effluent pipelines and outfalls in the   Willamette and Columbia Rivers, and in other water bodies in Oregon, Washington, Alaska, and   California. The Columbia River Intake and Discharge Facilities Project (herein “Project”) will need to   understand and address the site-specific conditions for design and permitting. Section 2 illustrates the   magnitude of our local and regional river outfall designs and studies and permitting – most accomplished   within the past 10 years. We also list a few projects over 15 years old that demonstrate how our outfall   designs withstand the test of time in durability and performance for our clients while meeting hydraulic   and dilution needs. In addition, Section 2 also lists our key intake design projects, along with several   hydroelectric projects. These example projects reflect the technical skill of our designers in all stages of   the process — site selection, geotechnical evaluation, hydraulics analyses, dilution modeling, and   structural and mechanical design – as well as our team skills in complex permitting, agency negotiations,   and riverbank restorations.   1.1 Jacobs Prioritizes Safety   At Jacobs, we believe the wellbeing of our people is fundamental to   our success. We are driven by deep emotional commitment and   active engagement that creates excellence in health, safety, security,   and sustainability across our projects. Our goal is beyond driving   statistics to zero. We believe our culture will make our people and   communities safer and healthier. We look for ways to recognize and   mitigate risks.    Jacobs clearly aligns with Dyno Nobel’s goal of prioritizing safety.   Jacobs has implemented a BeyondZero® safety culture that is about   keeping our people safe. It is about creating a culture of caring by actively engaging and involving   employees and influencing their beliefs and behaviors.    Our approach to your Project will leverage the proven Jacobs safety tools and practices. In addition, we   will adhere to all Dyno Nobel safety requirements, including site training, implementation of proper   personal protection equipment, and meeting all site-specific requirements.   DEEP ROOTS   Jacobs was   founded in 1947;   CH2M was founded   in Oregon in 1946   LOCAL  RESOURCES   400+ staff in  Portland   1,300 in OR/WA   Safety is not what we   do, it’s who we are. We   call it our way of life,   BeyondZero®, our  Culture of Caring.       Proposal for Engineering Services      2    1.2  History of Service to Dyno Nobel    Previously, Jacobs successfully delivered an   engineering cooling capacity study to Dyno Nobel for   the 20-million-gallons-per-day (mgd) Single Pass   Cooling Water Alternative Analysis project (see   Exhibit 1-1). The project consisted of an engineering   alternative analysis for increasing the cooling   capacity of the St. Helens plant’s non-contact   process cooling water system. Options consisted of   providing an alternate groundwater supply, wetlands   cooling, cooling tower cooling, increase surface water   supply. The project included development of a   Section 316(b) compliance strategy and preliminary   design of intake screens compliant with U.S.   Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Section   316(b) best technologies available. The project also   explored options for mitigating plant heat exchanger   fouling and microbial induced corrosion (MIC) issues   created by the untreated surface water non-contact   cooling water supply.    1.3  Unique Qualifications    In our approach, our team will work collaboratively with you to develop a design that provides long-term   value, simplified maintenance, and efficient operation. For this Project, we offer Dyno Nobel the following:   PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE  DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO   LOCATION AND  PERMITTING   Jacobs has completed previous geotechnical studies at the outfall   site as part of another project that will be leveraged to reduce Project   costs. The geotechnical work included borings along a transect near   the future outfall (see Appendix G). Jacobs has also developed an   approach and preliminary design for the Dyno Nobel plant intake   screens that will comply with EPA 316b as part of a Cooling Water   Effluent Alternative Analysis Study previously conducted.   INDUSTRY-LEADING  RIVER OUTFALL/INTAKE/   HYDROELECTRIC  EXPERIENCE AND   EXPERTISE   We have selected a team of key staff that offers breadth and depth of   planning, permitting, design, and operations experience for outfalls,   intakes, and hydroelectric facilities. Our team will be led by Phil   Martinez, PE (Project Manager), David Wilson and Byrl Thompson,   PE (Outfall Structure), James Kapla, PE (Cold Water Intake), Sonya   Reiser, PE (Hydroelectric Evaluation), and Steve Mader, PhD   (Permits). Combined, this core group has more than a century of   industry-leading experience in the very work required of Dyno Nobel   for this Project.           Exhibit 1-1.

Each is further detailed in Section 2. We also have many examples   of our outfall and diffuser designs that have been operating   successfully for decades, including Portland’s Tryon Creek   Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) outfall (27 years), Corvallis’   Water Resource Recovery Facility’s (WRRF) two outfalls (21 years),   Vancouver Marine Park and Westside Water Pollution Control   Facility (WPCF) outfalls (18 and 22 years), Centralia WPCF outfall   (15 years), and the Clark Regional Wastewater District outfall (44   years). We have a keen understanding of how to design outfalls and   diffusers to withstand tough physical conditions and to continue to   meet hydraulic and dilution requirements for the long-term design   life.   A PROVEN APPROACH TO  PERMITTING PROJECTS   Our permitting team led by Dr. Steve Mader has a proven ability to   systematically progress the Project and work through the   requirements with permitting agencies and stakeholders. The   permitting staff works closely with our technical team, will apply   practical logic and existing agency relationships to successfully   navigate the permitting process, and will satisfy permit conditions.   THE RIGHT PROJECT  MANAGER.   Phil Martinez, PE, brings 30 years of experience in management and   delivery of complex municipal and private water system projects,   including pipelines, intakes, outfalls, and treatment facilities. He is   particularly adept in guiding teams of leading subject matter experts   to complete projects successfully on time and on budget.             Proposal for Engineering Services      4    2. Similar Project Experience — Permitting on Navigable  Waters of Columbia River System   Jacobs’ technical capabilities are unmatched specific to river data collections, and river hydraulics,   bedform, and dilution modeling for evaluations and design of intakes and outfalls in the lower Columbia   River System and Willamette River.   Jacobs has conducted more than 60 field and modeling studies of outfalls in Oregon and Washington   during the past 15 years and more than 12 outfall designs in the past 10 years in the Pacific Northwest.   Section 2.1 highlights our local outfall designs and studies in the Portland/Vancouver area.    Jacobs has successfully provided Section 316(a&b) services to power utilities, manufacturing plants, and   refineries throughout the United States. Our successful project experience includes strategic compliance   planning, collecting, and interpreting ecological and impingement and entrainment data, engineering   feasibility studies, benefits valuation studies, preparation of permit application reports, along with   designing and constructing compliant clean water intake systems (CWIS). This experience is highlighted   in Section 2.2.   2.1  Similar Outfall Projects   Exhibit 2-1, along with the following   project descriptions, highlight recent   outfall design projects completed or   underway on the Lower Columbia and   Willamette Rivers. Jacobs is proud of   our work achievements and working   relationships with clients. All seven of   these recent projects include the same   elements required for the Dyno Nobel   Project, and five of the seven recent   projects listed here are outfall design   projects completed or underway on the   Lower Columbia River.    We understand the hydraulic and   sediment environment in the   Columbia River at the Dyno Nobel   discharge site.    The Salmon Creek WWTP, Boise-St.   Helens, and Vancouver Marine Park   Water Reclamation Facility (WRF)   outfall projects are directly comparable   to the project requirements of the Dyno   Nobel Project. These outfall projects   required design of an extended outfall   and multi-port diffuser into regions of the   Columbia River with active river bedform   migration that require analysis and   predictions of river sediment bedform Exhibit 2-1. Examples of Local Jacobs Outfall Designs and Studies     Proposal for Engineering Services         5   elevations and diffuser design adaptability to provide unimpaired diffuser operations. The Vancouver   Marine Park WRF outfall diffuser was constructed in 2010, the Boise-St. Helens outfall extension and   diffuser were constructed in 2005, and the Salmon Creek WWTP outfall and diffuser is in final design.   The Boise-St. Helens Outfall Extension and Diffuser, Salmon Creek WWTP Outfall, and Portland’s   Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant (CBWTP) Outfalls 001 and 003 Improvements all   required modeling of river bedform migrations and elevations for the design of diffuser risers and ports to   allow future unimpaired operations in the Columbia River environment.    Thus, we bring an in-depth understanding of outfall and diffuser designs approaches, permitting   strategies, and construction approaches for outfalls in the Columbia River.   Descriptions of similar, nearby outfall projects completed by our Jacobs outfall team are presented here.   These outfall projects are similar to the Dyno Nobel outfall project and present many of the same   challenges. In addition to these nearby outfall projects, our team has completed dozens of outfall projects   throughout North America and beyond. These other outfall projects present similar and different   challenges and reflect the wealth and breadth of experience comprised within our outfall team. A partial   listing of these other projects is presented in Appendix A.   Kapstone Packaging; Longview Mill Outfall Diffuser Rehabilitation; Columbia River   Work Completed 2014-2015; $1.5 Million Total Cost   Project Elements: bedform evaluation, conceptual and predesign engineering, contractor team   workshop, and final design   This project was a fast-track design development to rehabilitate a 350-foot, 48-inch steel outfall diffuser   disabled by an anchor-caused break to offshore a 120-foot section and sand wave burial of inshore   section. Detailed bathymetry survey images and dive inspection videos were used in design analyses of   repair options to meet hydraulic and dilution requirements. Feasible diffuser rehabilitation and repair   approaches were developed, an Engineering Report was prepared for agency approval, and final design   of the diffuser rehabilitation was completed to allow immediate construction. The design was completed in   9 months to allow pipe procurement and construction completion in 2015.   Exhibit 2-2.

Work included detailed bathymetry surveys, sub-  bottom surveys, and water quality surveys to use in design   analyses. Jacobs also completed an Engineering Report for   agency approval, conducted workshops with agencies, and   completed final design to allow immediate construction. The   design was completed in 10 months to allow pipe procurement   and construction completion was in 2004. In 2005, a Mixing Zone   Study was conducted to meet DEQ’s RMZ-IMD requirements.

Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant Outfall 003 Diffuser Improvements  to Extend Riser Lengths and Replace Check Valve Ports to Address Bedform Elevations       Proposal for Engineering Services      8    Jacobs also is designing riser extension and replacement elastomeric check valve ports for all risers on   both outfalls for model-predicted future bed elevations, and developing construction approaches with   marine construction firms to allow repairs during outfall operation.   Clackamas County WES; Tri-City WRRF  Outfall Modification; Willamette River    Work Completed: 2011-2012; $0.4 Million   Total Cost   Project Elements: field studies, bedform   evaluation, conceptual design, predesign   engineering, final design, construction   permitting, and SDC   This project was a fast-track design for   alternative river discharge concepts to provide   dilutions to avoid effluent ammonia limits and   comply with DEQ MAO deadline (Dec. 2012).   The most expeditious and cost-effective   modification to the existing three 42-inch port   submerged bankside diffuser was selected.   Jacobs also designed installation of a 48-inch   elastomeric check valve on one port and flow-control operation changes to direct dry season to check   valve. Installation was completed October 2012. In December 2012, WES received a letter of   commendation from the Director of DEQ for excellence in completing this project.   City of Vancouver; Vancouver Marine Park WRF Outfall Diffuser Modification (2009) and  Outfall Diffuser Design (2002); Columbia River   $1.8 Million Total Cost   Project Elements: field studies, bedform evaluation, conceptual design, predesign engineering, final   design, and construction permitting   We designed and permitted a 200-foot extension of a 60-inch steel outfall for a buried 160-foot diffuser in   the Columbia River with 20 10-inch risers and 8-inch ports. Our team designed and permitted in 2001 and   installed in 2002. In 2008, river bed elevation changes caused some port burials to require modification.   We designed, permitted, and installed diffuser modifications in 2009, adding 2-foot riser extensions and   adding 10-inch elastomeric check valve ports to resist the  potential for sand intrusion.   2.2  Similar Intake Projects    Jacobs brings unique strength in the integration of engineering skills to evaluate screen designs, pump   operations, and intake characteristics with the fisheries behavior, life-cycle, swimming speed, and other   attributes critical to demonstrate the best application of science and technology to decision makers.   Jacobs has significant water intake structure engineering experience, including both physical installations   and Section 316(b) engineering studies of alternative intake technologies and operational measures on a   variety of facility types across the United States. We have worked on more than 100 water intake   structure projects that have included the planning, design, and construction of intake structures, fish   screens, and diversion weirs at fossil and nuclear power plants, hydroelectric plants, manufacturing   plants, and municipality/public utility districts. Jacobs has experience with more than 50 different intake   technologies and operational modifications to address Section 316(b) issues, and we have the expertise   to efficiently determine their feasibility and implementation cost based on site-specific factors.   Exhibit 2-7. Tri-City WRRF Outfall Modification     Proposal for Engineering Services         9   Descriptions of similar fish screen projects within the Columbia River system and similar 316(b)   compliance fish screening projects completed by our Jacobs intake team are presented in this section.   These intake fish screening projects are similar to the Dyno Nobel intake project with respect to the likely   best intake screening options (tee screens). In addition to these intake projects, our team has completed   many other similar intake projects throughout North America. These other intake projects present many of   the same challenges facing Dyno Nobel. A partial listing of these other projects is presented in   Appendix B.   Chelan Public Utility District No. 1; Chelan River Project Tailrace Pump Station;  Chelan County, Washington   As part of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) re-  licensing requirements for the 53-megawatt (MW) Lake Chelan   Hydroelectric Project, the District was required to enhance   steelhead and Chinook salmon spawning habitat in the Chelan   River. Diversions for power generation historically left little or no   flows in the Chelan River, which is bypassed by the hydroelectric   project. Jacobs provided design and construction-phase services   for a 250-cubic-feet-per-second (cfs) (162 mgd) intake, pump   station, canal, and diffuser   outlet structure. The   project provides minimum   flows in Reach 4 of the   Chelan River to augment   releases of up to 80 cfs   from the dam. The low-  head pump station avoids   the lost energy of   additional releases from   the dam at this 377-foot   head project.    The pump station includes five 150-horsepower (hp) constant-speed submersible pumps arranged in a   slant configuration with 5-foot-diameter cylindrical wedge wire tee-screens dedicated to each pump. The   42- and 48-inch-diameter pump columns are supported on 24-inch-diameter drilled piers. The piers were   constructed inside casings placed with a land-based Leffer hydraulic oscillating drill rig, which addressed   difficult subsurface conditions. This pump station design approach saved millions of dollars in   construction costs in comparison to a traditional cast-in-place concrete wet well pump station. Other   aspects of the project included installation of a low-level outlet at Lake Chelan Dam and construction of   over 4 acres of stream and riparian habitat. At the time of the project commemoration on November 5,   2009, District biologists counted 281 Chinook redds (or nests) within the enhanced habitat area, a   testament to the success of the project. Fulfillment of the FERC re-licensing requirements will allow the   District to operate the hydroelectric facility for a 50-year license period. This project was winner of the   2010 National Hydropower Association (NHA) Outstanding Stewards of America’s Waters Award and was   a 2011 American Council of Engineering Companies (ACEC) Engineering Excellence National Gold   Award winner.   Exhibit 2-8A and 2-8B. Wedge Wire Tee-Screens Attached to Intake Pipe       Proposal for Engineering Services      10    Xcel Energy; High Bridge Combined Cycle Project; St. Paul, Minnesota   Jacobs was the engineering, procurement, and   construction contractor of this new 570-MW   natural gas-fired plant, which replaced an existing   270-MW coal-fired plant built in 1923. The plant   uses river water for direct cooling, and Jacobs   performed the detail design and construction of a   new intake and screening system for the new   power station. The existing river water intake   system was reconfigured for compliance with   316(b) regulations and included new cylindrical   wedge-wire screens, compressed air wedge-wire   screen cleaning system, anti-freeze pumping   system, and new circulating water pumps.    David Wilks of Xcel Energy stated that his   company’s ongoing focus on safe practices remains unflagging now that High Bridge has been   commissioned. “Jacobs’ approaches to project safety, planning, and management have been very   impressive,” Wilks concluded. “Personally, I consider High Bridge a nearly perfectly executed project. My   compliments and congratulations to Jacobs for a job well done.”   Dominion Energy Resources; Multiple Fossil Stations, Development of Technical  Evaluation of Compliance Alternatives for Section 316(b) for 14 Stations; Illinois, Indiana,  Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Virginia, West Virginia,  and Wisconsin    Jacobs provided Dominion with a review of the technologies and   operational measures that could be used at each power station to   be fully compliant with the Section 316(b) rule while minimizing   compliance costs. Technologies included screening systems,   physical and behavioral barriers, and operational measures that   could reduce flows. Finally, Jacobs evaluated the possibility of   using restoration to meet rule requirements.    Jacobs’ exceptionally qualified, one-of-a-kind compliance team of   power plant engineers, intake structure engineers, Section 316(b)   specialists, and biologists visited the plants to gain an   understanding of plant-specific compliance issues and review technical information such as pump data,   plant manuals, biological impingement and entrainment data, and intake structure specifications. Jacobs   screened the alternatives based on their ability to reduce impingement and entrainment, what were able   to be permitted, what did not severely affect plant operations, and what were feasible to install. For the   best options, Jacobs developed conceptual-level layouts and cost estimates for Dominion’s planners to   consider during their assessment of the impacts of Section 316(b) regulations. Jacobs assisted Dominion   with a consistent compliance approach across the plants, while also addressing necessary plant-specific   aspects.   Exhibit 2-9. Xcel Energy High Bridge Construction   Exhibit 2-10. Screening and Debris Trough  at a Dominion Facility     Proposal for Engineering Services         11   Dominion Energy Resources; Multiple Fossil and Nuclear Stations, Development of  Comprehensive Demonstration Studies for 13 Stations Pursuant to the Final Phase II  Rule for Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act; Illinois, Virginia, and West Virginia   Jacobs managed and prepared Comprehensive   Demonstration Studies (CDSs) that identified several   strategies Dominion could use to demonstrate compliance   with the Section 316(b) rule while minimizing compliance   costs. Our team developed a thorough understanding of   station-specific engineering constraints, operating   conditions, unique station attributes, and source water   body biological, chemical, and physical conditions to   overcome the primary challenge of developing low-cost   strategies for full compliance with the Final Rule for Section   316(b) at 13 generating stations.    These generating stations operated uniquely and were   located on a variety of cooling water-source water bodies.   The Dominion generating stations studied by Jacobs are   located on the Atlantic Ocean, freshwater rivers, the Great   Lakes, tidal rivers, Chesapeake Bay, and several cooling reservoirs. Jacobs developed a best-fit   approach, ensuring consistency in compliance approach across all plants, while also ensuring necessary   plant-specific aspects were addressed. Specific CDS components included:    • CWIS and source water-body data    • Impingement mortality and entrainment characterization (as it pertains to baseline and performance)    • Technology and compliance assessment information, including technology installation and operation   plan and (when needed) a design and construction technology plan    • Restoration plan, including adaptive management planning    For feasible alternatives, Jacobs developed detailed layout drawings and cost estimates. Jacobs worked   with a consultant to develop site-specific cost-benefit/cost-cost analyses that demonstrated the costs of   compliance exceeded the benefits. By demonstrating this important conclusion, the CDS solution to   compliance was to recommend restoration as the best rule-compliant approach. Jacobs then developed   conceptual, site-specific restoration plans and monitoring processes to be included in the CDS.    Our team also worked with Dominion staff and biological and economic consultants to provide quality   assurance/quality control (QA/QC) of field data and prepare verification monitoring planning.   2.3 Similar Hydropower Projects    Jacobs offers the full range of hydropower project services, from planning to final design, commissioning,   plant operation, and condition assessments at existing facilities. Services can be delivered alone or   together with the total suite of scientific, regulatory/licensing, economic, and public involvement services   necessary to develop the hydroelectric potential of water resources, conveyance systems, and treatment   facilities. We work with all types of projects and clients, including new installations, rehabilitations and   upgrades, additions at federal dams, micro-hydro developments, and additions on irrigation/municipal   water systems.   Our extensive experience with these types of facilities helps us to scale evaluations to fit the potential   need and outcome. In doing so, we optimize use of our client’s resources. We typically recommend a   Exhibit 2-11. Boats and Equipment Used by  Jacobs for Biological Evaluations at a Dominion  Facility       Proposal for Engineering Services      12    step-wise approach to evaluation of hydroelectric generation facilities—starting with an evaluation that   enables key decisions without great expenditure. This approach is available to Dyno Nobel, if desired,   and can be implemented on this Project.   A brief summary listing of our hydroelectric project portfolio is presented in Appendix C. We have also   included an overview sheet branded as CH2M HILL of our Hydroelectric Services in Appendix D.         Proposal for Engineering Services         13   3. Past Experience with DEQ and USACE Permitting    For the many outfall and water intake designs developed in Oregon and Washington by Jacobs over the   past 15 years, essentially all these projects have had Jacobs leading the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers   (USACE) permitting, including communications and consultations with the National Marine Fisheries   Services. Our permitting leads, engineers, and scientists are highly experienced in federal and state   agency communications to maintain the project schedule and optimize the least costly in-water   construction methodologies. Our proposed project team has decades of experience working with Oregon   DEQ staff during the review of outfall project designs, outfall studies, and National Pollutant Discharge   Elimination System (NPDES) permit studies and development.    In the last 12 years, our project team has submitted engineering   reports for DEQ reviews and held pre-application meetings with   DEQ staff for the following outfall projects: Boise-St. Helens   Outfall Extension and Diffuser, Clackamas Kellogg Creek WRRF   Outfall Improvement, Wilsonville WWTP Outfall Improvement,   Clackamas Tri-City Outfall Modification, Coos Bay WWTP#2   Outfall Improvements, and the Portland CBWTP Outfalls 001 and   003 Improvements. We are well versed in the DEQ requirements   and expectations for these reports and agency meetings. All of   our engineering reports have been approved by DEQ with only   minor or no comments.    In addition, our project team lead for diffuser designs, outfall   mixing studies, and NPDES permitting – David Wilson – has more   than 15 years of direct working experience with key staff in the   DEQ Northwest District Office, including Rob Burkhart. David has   been working with Rob Burkhart on the Boise-St. Helens Outfall   Project, the Oregon LNG Project, and the Troutdale Energy   Center Project.               “Your dedication to detail,  unsurpassed quality of work, and  personal expertise was key to  achieving our outfall project  success…and your ability to  communicate at all levels so everyone  understood what was necessary to  achieve environmental compliance  was invaluable.” —Joseph Kovich  (Outfall Project Manager and  Environmental Manager, Boise  Paper, St. Helens, OR)     Written about David Wilson in a letter  of appreciation after the completion of  the outfall design, permitting, and  construction.       Proposal for Engineering Services      14    4. Proposed Approach   Jacobs has developed our project approach based on our understanding of the Dyno Nobel operations,   discharge, and intake water systems; the hydraulic and sediment transport environment of the lower   Columbia River near Columbia City; our extensive experience designing, permitting, and constructing   outfalls on the lower Columbia and Willamette Rivers; the Mixing Zone/Excess Thermal Load Compliance   Schedule defined in the new NPDES permit; and Dyno Nobel’s need for an effective modification to the   cooling water intake structure. The Jacobs team will collaborate with Dyno Nobel to accomplish the   following key objectives:   • Design modifications to the Cooling Water Intake Structure to achieve federal rules for fisheries   protection and meet the NPDES permit schedule for submittals and completion   • Determine the best alignment for the new outfall, while carefully considering routing constraints   • Design a new outfall and diffuser with optimized dilution performance to achieve the required thermal   discharge requirements and water quality standards with a defined safety factor to allow for future   changes   • Provide a diffuser design that is adaptable to changes in river bedforms, seasonal flow changes, and   future more stringent requirements    • Successfully manage permitting and environmental documentation to maintain project schedule and   allow for construction in 2022    • Successfully deliver the design, permitting, and construction to allow operational start in 2023   4.1 Outfall Modification Plan   We understand that Schedule C – Compliance Schedule in the current NPDES permit defines a detailed   schedule for interim deliverables required by DEQ and for completion of the Mixing Zone/Excess Thermal   Load Limit Compliance Schedule for Dyno Nobel. The compliance schedule specifies:    • 12 months after permit effective (March 1, 2020) – Submit status report on Outfall Modification Plan   • 24 months after permit effective (March 1, 2021) – Submit Outfall Modification Plan (Engineering   Report) to DEQ with plans, specifications, and preliminary outfall mixing modeling results; and   submittal of a confirmation letter that all permit applications for this Project have been submitted to   agencies   • 36 months after permit effective (March 1, 2022) – Submit status report on Outfall Modification Project   to DEQ   • 48 months after permit effective (March 1, 2023) – Outfall Modification Project construction completed   • 51 months after permit effective (June 1, 2023) – Submit post-construction Outfall Mixing Study   Report to DEQ   • 54 months after permit effective (Sept 1, 2023) – Achieve full compliance with final permit ETL limits   Jacobs has the experience and a successful record of fast-track design and permitting to meet NPDES   permit compliance schedules and requirements. We have undertaken this approach for many of the   projects presented in Section 2, including: Kapstone Packaging Longview Mill Outfall, the Boise-St.   Helens Outfall, and the Clackamas Tri-City Outfall. Our proposed approach for this Dyno Nobel Project is   presented in the following sections.     Proposal for Engineering Services         15   4.1.1 Outfall Structure Design Options    The Jacobs project team will evaluate the two alternatives or “Outfall Structure Design Options” that are   identified in the request for proposals (RFP). Other alternatives may be identified and discussed with   Dyno Nobel to assess the value in including them in the evaluation. However, our proposed approach is   based on maximizing cost efficiency by focusing on the design option(s) that we know from our   experience will be successful and lowest cost.   The lower-cost, single-pipe, multi-port diffuser outfall approach will meet applicable current water quality   (including temperature) requirements, as outlined in Dyno Nobel’s latest NPDES permit. This outfall   approach is common practice, is an approach we have decades of experience implementing, and is far   lower in capital and operations and maintenance costs than other alternatives. This approach also   enables compliance with potential future, more-stringent requirements, including stricter temperature   requirements.   Installing the new outfall pipe in the existing service road to the north and east of the existing cooling   water discharge channel represents an excellent, low-cost, low-risk, simple, permit-friendly approach to   installing the new outfall pipeline between the existing energy discharge structure and the shoreline of the   Columbia River.    No major shut-down of the Dyno Nobel plant will be necessary – only a 1-day connection shut-down is   anticipated. Also, this simple, low-cost installation approach negates the need to consider a high-cost,   high-risk trenchless installation approach, such as horizontal directional drilling (HDD). HDD is typically   reserved for technically challenging conditions and avoidance of sensitive habitat conditions. Neither of   these conditions exist for this Project.   Also, note that the Jacobs team is aware of the adjacent Army Corps Section 408 Dike and the potential   impact of construction within this existing dike structure. Such construction would trigger review by the   USACE, which is a 12-month process. Additionally, there could be temporary and permanent easement   implications. It will be critical to engage the USACE early in the planning process with respect to this   issue. However, the overall schedule impacts can be largely mitigated by soliciting review in parallel with   the other environmental permits. Furthermore, it may be possible to avoid the dike structure.   We understand that it is critical to implement an outfall modification strategy that enables compliance with   future changes in requirements, including more stringent temperature dilution requirements. Doing so   avoids the potential for “sunk costs.” Fortunately, the most cost-effective strategy available to Dyno Nobel   also enables this flexibility for future compliance. We will summarize the results of the evaluation in a brief   report that includes cost information to enable Dyno Nobel to select the best approach to meeting current   requirements as well as potentially more stringent future requirements.    The estimated fee for this task is presented in the RFP Pricing Form, Line Item 1 as included in Appendix   I of this submission.    4.1.2 Hydro Electric Option Feasibility Study   The Jacobs project team will develop cost estimates for the anticipated revenue from a new hydroelectric   generation facility. That estimated cost will be compared to the estimated cost of a new hydroelectric   generation facility installed in a new concrete vault structure. Additionally, potential costs associated with   upstream pipeline replacement will be identified. Permitting requirements will be identified and associated   cost estimates will be developed. A pay-back period on the capital investment will be calculated. A report   summarizing the work will be submitted to Dyno Nobel for its consideration. The report will be sufficient to   enable Dyno Nobel to select whether or not to proceed with implementation of the new facility.       Proposal for Engineering Services      16    The estimated fee for this task is presented in the RFP Pricing Form, Line Item 2 as included in   Appendix I of this submission.    4.1.3 Diffuser Design Development   The diffuser design development is an iterative process to select the suitable diffuser site and then   develop the diffuser configuration design to achieve optimized diffuser depth, length, riser, and port   configurations to optimize dilution performance – incorporating diffuser riser adaptability for the site-  specific river bedform variability. The diffuser site selection will use available and newly collected river bed   bathymetry and sediment information in our evaluation of river bedform and elevation change potential at   diffuser sites.   We understand the technical analyses, design considerations, and permitting requirements for installation   of a new outfall diffuser into the Columbia River. River bed condition, morphology, and current flow   characteristics are unique to each diffuser siting and design. Exhibit 4-1 and Exhibit 4-2 illustrate site-  specific conditions in the Columbia River and bedform analyses by Jacobs used to design new outfall   diffusers and to solve bedform burial challenges at existing outfall diffusers in the river. Bedform changes   will need to be evaluated using historical and newly collected detailed bathymetry data, sediment   characteristics (sizes), and river current velocities to model and predict bedform elevations and channel   changes for the preferred diffuser sites. Our River Analysis and Modeling team have experience and   expertise with these bedform evaluations for diffuser designs on many Pacific Northwest rivers, and   specifically the Willamette and Columbia Rivers.    Exhibit 4-1. Illustration of Columbia River Bedform Impacting an Existing Multi-port Diffuser Requiring Design of  Retrofits to Maintain Function     Proposal for Engineering Services         17   Any outfall diffuser in the river will need to recognize and address commercial and recreational uses at   the diffuser site and the structure effects on boat navigation, anchoring, and recreational fishing. Site   conditions that are particularly important to design include the riverbed slope stability, sub-bottom   geological conditions, ambient currents, woody debris transport, and shoreline stability and erosion   hazard. Jacobs team will evaluate and discuss these site conditions with Dyno Nobel during the outfall   route and diffuser site selection. Private aids to vessel navigation are often installed to protect the new   structure.   The reasonable potential analysis (RPA) developed using Dyno Nobel wastewater chemistry data and   temperature data along with background Columbia River chemistry and temperature data (collected   during the survey work) will be used to define the target design dilution factors needed for the outfall   diffuser. Our initial evaluation indicates that a minimum dilution factor of 55 is needed to achieve full   compliance with the NPDES permit Excess Thermal Load limits.   Our approach will develop the outfall design options that meet the hydraulic and dilution requirements,   regulatory restrictions (fish passage and exposure), morphological conditions (that is, velocities, river bed   stability and geology, and woody debris loads), and structural durability expectations for design life.   Outfall pipe materials, shoreline and riverbed stability, construction methods, and costs will be evaluated   in the preliminary design. Shoreline and riverbed stability will be evaluated in the preliminary design   based on available information. Review and selection of outfall pipe materials will be conducted in   coordination with Dyno Nobel. The design options for the outfall and multi-port diffuser will be influenced   by target dilution requirements, hydraulic limitation, riverbed stability, construction methods, and costs.   4.1.4 Preliminary Design Report    The work product from the preliminary design will be the Preliminary Design Engineering Report that   defines the basis of the outfall and diffuser design and includes the following: project background and   objectives; design issues; project benefits; characteristics of the river site; effluent characteristics; water   quality standards and target design dilutions; an evaluation of outfall options and the selected option;   dilution and hydraulic modeling of the selected option; a demonstration of water quality standards   compliance; a review of design criteria for the selected outfall and diffuser (including plan and profile   drawings; pipe material and outfall elements; outfall hydraulics; construction methods; a cost estimate;   and a summary of permitting. The Preliminary Design Engineering Report will incorporate the outfall   mixing zone information that is required by ODEQ’s RMZ-IMD for mixing zone allocation for a new outfall   in the Columbia River. Jacobs has successfully applied this approach of combining the mixing zone study   Exhibit 4-2. Illustrations of Bathymetry Data and Bedform Analyses on the Columbia River Used to Select Diffuser Sites  and for Diffuser Designs at the New Salmon Creek WWTP Outfall Diffuser and for the Boise-St. Helens Outfall Site       Proposal for Engineering Services      18    information into the design engineering report in the Clackamas Tri-Cities and Kellogg Creek, Wilsonville,   Seaside, and Boise-St. Helens outfall design reports. The Preliminary Design Engineering Report also   provides the basis for the information presented in the permit applications and biological assessment   document. The Preliminary Design Engineering Report will be submitted to Oregon DEQ for review and   approval. Our design engineering reports for outfall projects have typically been approved within 2 to   3 months of submission in Oregon.   4.1.5 Detailed Design, Bidding, and Construction Contract Documents   The Jacobs team will complete detailed design drawings and specifications as well as bidding and   contract forms to enable selection of a low-price contractor to complete construction. The Jacobs team   will implement its standard design approach that involves review at the 60 percent, 90 percent, and   100 percent completion stages.   4.2 Cooling Water Intake Structure   Our proposed approach is presented herein. It is based on confirming understanding with Dyno Nobel of   the NPDES and federal 316(b) requirements and their timing. It is also based heavily on using work that   has already been completed to date by our project team for Dyno Nobel.   4.2.1 Review of NPDES Permit Requirements for Compliance   The Jacobs team can meet the schedule requirements presented by Dyno Nobel in the RFP. We note,   per our review of the NPDES permit, and our experience with the typical compliance approach with these   types of projects, that compliance with the Section 316(b) fish-screening requirements could be   implemented over a longer time horizon than what is presented in the RFP. If Dyno Nobel is interested in   exploring the possibility of deferring capital expenditure until required by DEQ, we are available to assist   with that effort. Otherwise, we are ready and willing to press ahead with the schedule requirements   outlined in the RFP. An overview of the Section 316(b) compliance process is included in the CH2M-titled   document in Appendix E that was prepared by our team’s intake lead, James Kapla, a national leader in   intake fish screening projects. We note the following key requirements of the NPDES permit that our work   will satisfy:   • A “work plan” within 1 year of the effective date of the NPDES permit (Mach 1, 2019). This document   is required to assess current conditions and compliance. Most of this work has already been   completed as part of our team’s prior work.   • No later than 180 days before the expiration of the current NPDES permit, Dyno Nobel must submit a   series of seven PAR reports to DEQ, providing the information required in 40 CFR 122.21(r)(2) and   (3) and applicable provisions of paragraphs (4), (5), (6), (7), and (8). This compliance date is late in   2023 and is apparently reflective of the extended compliance timeline being granted by DEQ. Meeting   the stated Dyno Nobel compliance strategy would require completion of these reports as an initial   activity. These reports include the following permit application requirements (PARs):   – PAR (r)(2): Source Water Physical Data   – PAR (r)(3): Cooling Water Intake Structure Data   – PAR (r)(4): Source Water Baseline Biological Characterization Data   – PAR (r)(5): Cooling Water System Data   – PAR (r)(6): Impingement Mortality Reduction Plan   – PAR (r)(7): Performance Studies   – PAR (r)(8): Operational Status     Proposal for Engineering Services         19   4.2.2 Cooling Water Intake Structure Design Options   This portion of the work has essentially been completed already, including provision of costs for   alternative approaches. It was completed by our team in 2016, as part of a larger project to address   options for lower-temperature cooling water. Refer to a copy of the cover of the technical memorandum   report for this work in Appendix F. We propose to review the results of this work with Dyno Nobel to   enable selection of the preferred Section 316(b)-compliant fish screening approach. This approach will   save Dyno Nobel time and money and leverage the work that has already been completed by the same   team that we are proposing for this Project.   The estimated fee for this task is presented in the RFP Pricing Form, Line Item 3 as included in   Appendix I of this submission.    4.2.3 Cooling Water Modification Plan   Once a preferred intake screening approach is selected, the Jacobs team will develop a comprehensive   Cooling Water Modification Plan (CMP) that will include design development to approximately the   30 percent stage. The CMP would address the required aspects of the Project to enable review by DEQ,   the National Marine Fisheries Service, and other applicable agencies. Presuming that tee screens are   selected because of their low cost and long history of reliability, approval of this approach should not   present substantial challenge.   4.2.4 Detailed Design, Bidding, and Construction Contract Documents   The Jacobs team will complete detailed design drawings and specifications as well as bidding and   contract forms to enable selection of a low-price contractor to complete construction. The Jacobs team   will implement its standard design approach that involves review at the 60 percent, 90 percent, and    100 percent completion stages.   4.2.5 Post-Construction Monitoring and Optimization   Some impingement and entrainment compliance improvements require monitoring and optimization to be   completed and reported to DEQ after installation. However, presuming the tee screens are installed, with   design intake velocities of 0.5 feet per second or less, no permit driven monitoring or optimization would   be required. The reason for this is that this approach is known to DEQ and other national regulatory   agencies to be effective and reliable. The experienced Jacobs team, with its wealth of knowledge of   316(b) compliance will guide Dyno Nobel on the installation of a low-cost, reliable system that is easy to   operate and maintain.   4.3 Construction Management Services   Jacobs will provide a veteran construction manager along with the design team to provide construction   support. The Jacobs construction manager will conduct regular site observations and provide consistent   contractor communications. We also have inhouse construction cost estimators with an extensive   database for outfall and in intake projects to baseline construction costs and assist in assessing any   construction change order options. Our construction management experience and proven construction   management best practices will optimize the potential for a successful construction phase.    4.4 Permit Application Completion    Permitting processes planned properly avoid costly delays. From our experience with our other outfall   projects in Oregon and on the Columbia River, successful project permitting requires early, frequent, and   clear communication with the design team, our client, and with natural resources and permitting agencies.       Proposal for Engineering Services      20    We would approach this Project with the understanding that Dyno Nobel expects to review and approve   all regulatory submittals and commitments, and that Jacobs assumes the role of executive secretary by   coordinating with applicable agencies.    Our team’s approach to meeting schedule and permitting needs is to involve our permitting team early so   they can guide the project team in the implication(s) of the design decisions on the permitting process.   We also like to engage regulatory agencies early in the process to gain their input on potential concerns   or special design requirements to avoid rework. Staff at the regulatory agencies know our team well, trust   our work, and appreciate our early engagement approach.    We will develop an Environmental Compliance Matrix, use it as a living document, and update it monthly.   This helps Dyno Nobel and our team track required permits, investigation/document preparation, and   review timelines with dates of recent or upcoming agency communications.    One of our first efforts will be to develop a comprehensive permitting strategy focused on creating   defensible route selection, compliant diffuser and intake screen design, and reviewable environmental   documentation. Dr. Steve Mader’s success in streamlining complex environmental permitting will guide   our strategy to address requirements and manage potential risks. This strategy will define a risk-based   approach, along with the following key considerations:   • Define the extent to which we can rely on the existing natural and cultural resources information for   the Project vicinity   • Leverage regulatory efforts from prior effluent outfall diffuser/intake permitting    • Conduct pre-application meetings with resources and land use agencies    • Prepare alternatives analyses for pipeline routing and outfall siting that comply with Clean Water Act   Section 404(b)(1) guidelines    • Engage permitting team early so that the engineering design considers environmental constraints and   sensitive sites between the facility and the river   • Applicability of fish screen design criteria in the National Marine Fisheries Service’s Anadromous   Salmonid Passage Facility Design (2011)   • Address agency concerns about indirect and cumulative effects on fish, fish passage, and critical   habitat    • Decide whether to proceed with a single or dual permitting effort for the diffuser and intake; also,   assess whether separate early approvals will be needed for geotechnical investigation   Our understanding of regulatory requirements and initial assessment of permitting risks and how they   interact are presented in Table 4-1 on the following page. Although the list of permits and approvals is   meaty, and some uncertainties about levels of effort will be resolved after initial reviews, the risks appear   manageable given adequate time to prepare.    The permit list acknowledges the many interdependencies among applicable regulations, which allows for   efficiencies in application preparations. The permitting levels of effort and review timelines introduce a   certain amount of scheduling uncertainty, but the processes can be aided, and risks reduced, by   conducting pre-application meetings, preparing complete application packages, and diligently monitoring   the agency reviews.    The estimated fee for this task is presented in the RFP Pricing Form, Line Item 4 as included in   Appendix I of this submission.      Proposal for Engineering Services         21   Table 4-1.

Jacobs will complete this RMZ study in accordance with Oregon DEQ guidelines for a   Level 3 RMZ Study (defined in DEQ’s Regulatory Mixing Zone Internal Management Directive, 2012;   referred to as the RMZ-IMD). The RMZ study will include tracer injection into the effluent flow to allow field   measurements of the dilution performance at the defined acute and chronic mixing zone boundaries, as   well as concurrent measurements of ambient river currents and tidal elevations to provide key dilution   model inputs. These field tracer dilution measurements are collected to calibrate and validate the mixing   zone dilution model selection and application. The results of the field study, receiving water and effluent   characteristics data, dilution modeling, and assessment of discharge compliance with chemical and   temperature criteria will be developed into a technical report for submittal to Oregon DEQ.    The RMZ study will need to be scheduled to occur during low river flow conditions in September following   the construction of the new outfall, in accordance with the DEQ’s RMZ-IMD. The field tracer study and   modeling will provide validated outfall dilution factors for the critical low river flow condition that are used   as the critical condition in the NPDES permit. Decades of river flow and stage records for the Columbia   River will be used to define the critical river flow statistics (1Q10, 7Q10, 30Q5, and harmonic mean flow)   for use in the modeling of the critical river flow conditions, in accordance with the DEQ’s RMZ-IMD. In   addition, river hydraulic modeling (using the FlowMaster model) will be used to calculate river stage,   water depths, and current velocities under specific time periods that correspond with the low river flow   condition as well as the Spring river flow conditions. Specifically, river hydraulic modeling will be used to   calculate river water depths and current velocities during the Eulachon (smelt) life stages in the Columbia   River (February 1-April 30; April 1-30; and May 15-30). Dilution modeling will use these summer and   spring river water depths and velocities as inputs to calculate dilution factors for the low river flow   condition as well as the spring river flow conditions that correspond to Eulachon life stages present in the   Columbia River.    This is precisely the same technical support activity that Jacobs has provided for the Oregon and   Washington dischargers shown in our project experience lists. Jacobs’ team is widely recognized for our   expertise with outfall studies and we have performed approximately 90 percent of all outfall mixing studies   for dischargers in Oregon and Washington in the last 20 years.    The estimated fee for this task is presented in the RFP Pricing Form, Line Item 5 as included in    Appendix I of this submission.    4.6 Topographical and Geometric Surveys   These surveys will develop essential data for the design development of the new Dyno Nobel outfall  structure.    4.6.1 Topographical Survey   Jacobs will subcontract the on-land topographical survey to a firm that is acceptable to Dyno Nobel. We   propose using Mackay Sposito because of their familiarity with the Project site and their proximity in   Portland. The focus of the survey will be the on-land routing of the outfall pipe. We will discuss routing   options with Dyno Nobel, but it appears the lowest-cost and highest-advantage routing option is the   existing service road on the north and northwest side of the existing discharge channel. Installing the new   outfall pipeline existing discharge channel presents substantial technical and permitting challenges.   These will be discussed with Dyno Nobel prior to finalizing the surveying approach.     Proposal for Engineering Services         23   The estimated fee for this task is presented in the RFP Pricing Form, Line Item 6 as included in   Appendix I of this submission.    4.6.2 Bathymetric Survey   The river outfall route and diffuser site selection will rely on collected river bed bathymetry, river bed   sediment information, and current measurements that will be used in our evaluation of river bedform and   elevation change potential along the outfall route and at diffuser sites. To achieve optimized outfall route,   and diffuser depth and alignment will require newly collected river bed bathymetry, sediment, and   currents data. Information in our evaluation of river bedform and elevation change potential at diffuser   sites.   The river bed bathymetry offshore of the existing cooling water discharge channel is dynamic and   influenced by sediment sizes, upstream bedload contributions, and the magnitude, duration and   frequency of high river flow and current velocities, and river structures (i.e., pile dikes). A detailed   bathymetry survey of the outfall route study region will need to extend from the Dyno Nobel water intake   structure on the south to approximately 1,200 feet downstream (north) of the existing cooling water   discharge channel on the shoreline and extend to nearly the west edge of the federal navigation channel   to provide the coverage data for outfall route selection and for river bedform analyses. Jacobs will have   Solmar Hydro, our long-term collaborator on river studies, perform the multibeam sonar survey, assist us   in conducting multiple Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler measurements on cross-sections (during ebb and   flood tides), and collect surface sediments samples for physical analyses during the same multi-day field   event. Exhibit 4-3 illustrates the approximate region for the field data collections. Solmar Hydro will   provide a detailed bathymetry chart and survey report for use in the outfall design development.   Exhibit 4-3. Approximate Region of Data Collections on the Columbia River for Outfall Design Development   (after Google Earth, 2019)       Proposal for Engineering Services      24    4.6.3 Geotechnical Survey   The Jacobs team will use geotechnical data previously collected as part of a recent project to potentially   re-route a liquid natural gas pipeline. The drilling was conducted in 2012. During that project, two bore   holes were drilled – one to 120 feet below ground surface and the other to 55 feet below ground surface   (see Appendix G for the location of the two borings). These two borings (DR-1 and CR-1) provide   adequate information upon which to base outfall design and anchorage. Also collected as part of that   project was groundwater information to aid development of construction methods. Note, that this previous   project was discontinued. No additional water temperature information is needed to conduct the   preliminary evaluation of alternatives. Our project team has what it needs. Whether additional   geotechnical information is required depends on the results of the evaluation of the outfall structure   design options.    The estimated fee for this task is presented in the RFP Pricing Form, Line Item 6 as included in   Appendix I of this submission.    4.7 Water Quality Survey   The Water Quality Survey will develop necessary data for the design development of the new Dyno Nobel   outfall structure and for demonstration of water quality compliance. The Water Quality Survey will address   two Project needs: provide site-specific background Columbia River water chemistry data and provide   Whole Effluent Toxicity test data for discharge compliance documentation.    Three river water samplings will be performed in the summer period of 2019 to provide background   Columbia River water quality data. The river water samplings will include water column vertical profiles   (using a YSI Pro-DSS water quality instruments to measure temperature, pH, turbidity, and dissolved   oxygen over the entire water column) and collection of river water samples at two depths (surface and   near-bottom) at four sites in the river. River water sampling sites will be located and timed (with tides) to   capture background river water conditions outside of the existing Dyno Nobel discharge plume. Collected   river water samples will be submitted for laboratory analyses of metals, nutrients, conventional pollutants,   and organic chemicals found in Dyno Nobel wastewater. The first river water sampling event will be   coordinated with the bathymetry survey (see Section 4.5.2) and conducted from the Solmar Hydro work   vessel. Exhibit 4-3 on the previous page illustrates the approximate region for the field data collections.   Note that this first survey will include a multibeam sonar survey, Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler   measurements on cross-sections (during ebb and flood tides), collection of surface sediments samples   for physical analyses, and water quality survey sampling during the same multi-day field event. The   second and third water quality sampling events will be conducted in the summer of 2019 as separate field   data collections using the SHI work vessel.    Jacobs will develop RPA sheets using the DEQ Excel spreadsheets with data input from the Dyno Nobel   effluent chemistry data collected for the NPDES permit renewal and during the previous permit, along   with the background river chemistry data collected in the summer of 2019. The RPA will be used in the   diffuser design and engineering documentation of compliance with water quality standards.    In addition, Jacobs will utilize the existing Whole Effluent Toxicity (WET) test data available from Dyno   Nobel, as well as WET test results from 2019 testing to evaluate and document compliance with toxicity   requirements. If required by DEQ, additional WET tests can be conducted using mixtures of collected   wastewater and background Columbia River water. Jacobs has extensive experience performing such   site-specific WET tests in our bioassay lab.     Proposal for Engineering Services         25   We understand that the new NPDES permit requires Dyno Nobel to conduct WET monitoring – acute and   chronic bioassay - to cover 4 quarters of a year, and these WET tests can be conducted as 4 quarters in   the first year of permit or as one quarter each year for 4 years. We would recommend that Dyno Nobel   complete these 4 quarterly WET tests in the first year if possible to provide results to support the outfall   design and permitting.   The estimated fee for this task is presented in the RFP Pricing Form, Line Item 7 as included in   Appendix I of this submission.        Proposal for Engineering Services      26    5. Experience of Key Personnel and Resumes   Our proposed project team is extremely experienced in completing intake, outfall, hydropower, and   permitting projects. We have a history of working with Dyno Nobel, including the 2016 work that   addressed Section 316(b) compliance. Our core project team is used to working as a unit, and we are   nearby in both Oregon and Washington.

Proposed Completion Schedule   Dyno Nobel has established completion dates, as presented in the RFP. It is possible to meet each of   these completion dates. The Approach presented in this proposal and the Proposed Completion   Schedule—presented as Exhibit 7-1 on the following page—reflect completion of the Project to meet the   dates established by Dyno Nobel in its RFP. The Proposed Completion Schedule presented in Exhibit 7-1   shows the anticipated timeframes and chronology to complete tasks and activities of the Project. The   schedule also reflects completion of in-river construction activities during the agency-required timeframe   of November 1 through November 28.   Note that the post-construction Level 3 Mixing Study is shown in late winter and Spring of 2022. It is   possible that conditions will enable this timing and if DEQ allows it to be completed at this time, our team   can make this happen. However, Level 3 Mixing Studies are typically required during low flow conditions,   which are more common on the lower Columbia in September. Therefore, this activity could be conducted   during September of 2022.   The schedule reflects completion of the project approximately 1 year ahead of the Dyno Nobel   established deadlines. The Jacobs team will engage with Dyno Nobel regarding pursuit of a slower   schedule if desired by Dyno Nobel. Note that the recently executed NPDES permit does not require   completion of the Cold Water Intake Modification by the same November 2023 deadline established by   Dyno Nobel. While our team can and will meet Dyno Nobel’s schedule objectives, if Dyno Nobel were   interested in deferring capital investment on new Section 316(b)-compliant intake screens, we are   available to address how a greatly extended schedule may be possible.

Hydropower Project History    Proposal for Engineering Services               Client Project Timeline Project Description   City of San Diego Public Utilities   Department   March 2015 –   February 2016   Operations Optimization Program Small-scale Hydro Energy Recovery Project – Jacobs performed an initial site investigation and feasibility study of 8 potential hydropower projects ranging from 20  kW to 1.2 MW within the City’s water distribution system. Potential sites included Water Treatment Plants, Wastewater Treatment Plants, and Pressure Reducing Stations. A more detailed review was  then conducted for two of the sites.   PUD No. 1 of Snohomish County,    Everett, Washington    2014 to present  Sunset Fish Passage and Clean Energy Project – As part of its commitment to the environment and the reduction of greenhouse gases, The PUD is pursuing the development of clean, renewable  energy resources, including low-impact hydropower, in lieu of traditional fossil fuel–based energy resources. Following a review of more than 140 potential hydropower sites in western Washington, the  District identified Sunset Falls on the South Fork Skykomish River as the best opportunity to develop a substantial amount of generation in an environmentally friendly, cost-effective and socially- acceptable manner. The 30-MW Sunset Fish Passage and Clean Energy Project is the largest project currently under development by the District and is part of a comprehensive program that includes  energy conservation in conjunction with the development of tidal, solar, biomass and geothermal energy resources.   Jacobs was selected by the District in January 2014 to provide preliminary design, final design and services during construction for this hydropower project. The project includes a 2,500-cfs (1,600-mgd)  river intake, fry criteria fish screens with a bypass, approximately 2,300 feet of hard rock tunnel up to 30 feet in diameter, and an underground powerhouse with two 15-MW units. Key components are an  innovative river intake that eliminates the need for a diversion weir (while also minimizing aesthetic impacts), and re-location of the fish screen facility away from the river to eliminate the need for a large  rock cavern.   The 90-foot-tall Sunset Falls is a natural barrier to upstream fish passage; however, ESA-listed fish including Chinook salmon, steelhead and bull trout have been trapped and hauled above the falls since  1958 to facilitate access to 100 miles of formally inaccessible habitat. More than 124,000 fish were transported in 2009 by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW), making this one of the  most successful trap-and-haul operations in the Pacific Northwest. Jacobs has been working with the District since 2009 to design comprehensive upgrades to this rapidly deteriorating facility, and it is  anticipated that the upgrades will serve as part of the project protection, mitigation and enhancement measures. Jacobs will also provide general support for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  (FERC) permitting process, a Stream Power and Debris Study, and a Transportation Impact Analysis.   The Phase I preliminary design and studies were completed in 2014. Total construction cost is approximately $130M.

Project Manager; Chelan Falls Rearing/Acclimation Facility; Public Utility District No. 1 of Chelan  County, WA. Managed the alternatives evaluation, site selection, conceptual design, final design and  construction of the Chelan Falls Rearing/Acclimation Facility. Due to the poor release location and lack of  spawning grounds in the vicinity of Turtle Rock Island on the main stem Columbia River, sub-yearling  Chinook historically reared at this location have tended to stray to other tributaries. As such, the District  and the Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) Hatchery committee made the decision to convert to a yearling  program and to construct a replacement facility for the acclimation of Summer Chinook. Relying on  extensive knowledge of the District’s existing hatchery program, Jacobs evaluated various facility  configurations and site locations to identify a preferred alternative which efficiently and cost-effectively  met the goals of the program. The selected facility is located adjacent to the 59-megawatt Chelan Falls  Powerhouse and accommodates 600,000 Chinook in four 45-foot-diameter Cornell-type round ponds.

Helped to implement changes in two of the three  major discharge streams at the facility, and these changes would affect stormwater and cooling water  discharges from the facility. The changes in the discharges were developed to reduce water use, reduce  thermal discharge loads, relocate the stormwater discharge site (for most flows), and to improve mixing  (dilutions) for the stormwater discharges. Assisted in the preparation of a technical report that provided  details on the compressor cooling water upgrades, diversion of industrial site stormwater, evaluation of  the dilution performance of Outfall 001 for the phased flow modifications, and the schedule and permitting  of these projects. Dilution modeling was conducted to evaluate the existing and a modified diffuser to  assess dilutions and hydraulic operations with the changed effluent flows. Performed modeling runs that  provided plausible and defensible predictions of dilution performance that would be achieved under  critical (worst-case) conditions and defined the range of anticipated dilutions that will be achievable for the  existing and modified outfall diffuser configurations.   Modeling Lead and Field Team Member; Outfall Mixing Zone and Dilution Study, Willamette River;  Confidential Client; Portland, OR. Conducted an outfall mixing zone/dilution study to provide site- specific field measurements for the outfall under low river flow; develop river flow and stage statistics for  critical discharge conditions; apply field measurements in dilution modeling; develop dilution modeling  results for a range of critical river flow conditions; and evaluate the discharge with the mixing zone rules  including the thermal plume provisions in the Oregon Administrative Rules. The field team collected site- specific data during a 1-week period at low river flow and stage. The field activities included cross- sectional profiles of depths and velocities in the river near the outfalls, and extensive dye dilution  measurements at the existing mixing zone boundaries as well as more distant locations. Following the  field studies, analyzed and summarized the results of the field measurements. These field data and past  tracer studies were used to select and calibrate appropriate dilution models for each outfall. Dilution  modeling analyses included low river flow condition and off-season design conditions to represent critical  receiving water conditions at the discharge sites. Based on the results of the field study and dilution  modeling, alternative mixing zone dimensions were proposed for acceptance by the Department of  Environmental Quality.

The project involves one segment of  trenchless pipe installation beneath an existing bridge and  drainage. Required a detailed evaluation of seismic design  requirements with the level of service goal for the pipeline to  remain fully operational following a 2,500-year return interval  seismic event. The seismic design is dominated by the  Cascadia Subduction Zone event, but also includes  contribution from local crustal faults. Detailed assessment of  liquefaction triggering susceptibility, evaluation of residual soil  strengths, potential for slope failures both during and following  the design seismic event has been completed for the project  and presented to a peer-review seismic design group.  Participated in a seismic design working group to review and  set seismic design criteria for the project and to review seismic  designs completed by other consulting teams for other  segments of the pipeline project.    Geotechnical Task Lead; Colwood Pipeline Project; Port of  Portland; Portland, OR. Lead geotechnical engineer for  design of a 72-inch-diameter reinforced concrete stormwater  pipe to connect McBride Slough to Columbia Slough. The  project, which included design of intake and outfall structures  on the banks of the two sloughs, had segments of pipeline with  burial depths more than 25 feet. Responsibilities included         EDUCATION   M.S., Engineering/Geotechnical  Engineering, Colorado State University   B.S., Civil Engineering, Colorado State  University   REGISTRATIONS/  CERTIFICATIONS   Professional Engineer: Oregon, 1998  (No. 58496); Washington (No. 55243);  Virginia (No. 0402058342)   DISTINGUISHING QUALIFICATIONS    Extensive experience performing  geological hazard assessments  for projects across Oregon, with  specific focus on seismicity,  liquefaction and lateral spread,  tsunami, and landslides                    Todd Cotten, PE GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING     26    developing and overseeing the geotechnical exploration and laboratory testing program, geotechnical and  seismic design, development of geotechnical data and recommendation reports, and providing  observation during construction.    Lead Geotechnical Engineer; Kinsman Road Pipeline; WWSP; Wilsonville, OR. Led the geotechnical  evaluation and design of 3,000-foot section of 66-inch-diameter water supply pipeline. This welded steel  transmission main is located adjacent to and beneath a new segment of Southwest Kinsman Road,  between SW Barber Street and Boeckman Road. The pipeline is being designed to remain operational  following the 2,500-year return interval seismic event. Designing to this event involves careful evaluation  of liquefaction susceptibility of underlying soil, assessment of static and seismic slope stability and flow  failure mechanisms, and consideration for other seismic risks such as fault rupture and impacts from  nearby utilities that could be damaged during a seismic event. The project involved one segment of  trenchless pipe installation completed using open-face pipe jacking to pass beneath an existing 24-inch- diameter water supply pipeline. This pipeline is located in an area of high groundwater, along a BPA  transmission corridor, and the design was completed on a compressed design schedule to allow  construction at the same time as the new road.   Geotechnical Engineer; Will Crandall Reservoir; City of Hillsboro; Portland, OR. This $26 million  project includes a 10-million-gallon AWWA D110 wire wound concrete reservoir and 20-million-gallons- per-day (mgd) pump station. The soils at this particular site were determined to be highly susceptible to  seismic induced liquefaction to depths of up to 100 feet. Alternative methods evaluated for mitigation of  the liquefiable soils beneath the reservoir and pump station included deep driven piles, cement deep soil  mixing (CDSM), and jet grouting. CDSM was selected as the least cost and least disruptive alternative  and an extension ground improvement program was incorporated into the contract. Assisted with  development of earthwork and ground improvement specifications and coordinated with construction  management staff to perform geotechnical observations during construction.     Geotechnical Task Lead; Oregon Pipeline Project; LNG Development Company, LLC, and Oregon  Pipeline Company, LLC (doing business as Oregon LNG); Warrenton, OR. Lead geotechnical  engineer for pipeline corridor assessment and evaluation of geologic hazards for 87 miles of proposed  36-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline running between a proposed terminal in Warrenton, Oregon and the  City of Woodland, Washington. Between August 2007 and March 2009 managed and supervised  geotechnical field explorations at 11 proposed river, levee, and highway crossings where horizontal  directional drilling (HDD) installation methods would be used to construct the proposed pipeline. The HDD  crossings include three bores with proposed lengths greater than 4,500 feet. Authored the Geologic  Resources Report for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) permitting process. Currently  working to develop a Section 408 permit application for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for pipeline  crossings of flood control levees and navigation channels, including the Columbia River. Work included  evaluation of geologic hazards along the 87 miles of pipeline. Geologic hazards evaluated included  seismic ground shaking, landslides, liquefactions, subsidence, and flooding. Conducted meetings with  landowners to discuss geologic conditions and concerns, performed reviews of the pipeline route to  evaluate and avoid areas of high landslide potential, and provided internal review and updates to the  geotechnical investigation report and site-specific seismic hazard evaluation.
