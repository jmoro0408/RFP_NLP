September 8, 2020    Mr. Rich Unverferth  Director of Engineering  Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District   Subject: Proposal for Bissell Point WWTF Fine Screen, Concrete and Gate Improvements (12548)   Dear Mr. Unverferth,   Upgrading the headworks at Bissell Point is critical to reducing high O&M costs associated with the  comminutors and downstream pumping and treatment equipment. New screening facilities will also improve  operation of the rehabilitated trickling filters and future fluidized bed incinerators. But retrofitting fine screens  into an existing treatment plant is not a simple matter. Screenings loadings, hydraulics, screen type and size,  and screenings transport and processing equipment must all be carefully designed and balanced with  constructability and cost considerations in mind.

Project Manager Vice President Missouri Operations     Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District Bissell Point WWTF Fine Screens (12548)     2009-STL-P0044 2        Understanding of the Project and Technical Approach  We Understand the Project and the Facility  The Bissell Point Wastewater Treatment Facility provides secondary treatment to  wastewater flows generated in the Bissell Point Service Area. The treatment facility  also plays a prominent role in the District’s Long-Term CSO Control Plan by treating  significant quantities of wet weather flow generated in combined sewer areas. Peak  flows of up to 350 MGD or more are handled by the existing treatment facilities  during wet weather.   The current facility provides preliminary treatment (grit removal, comminution, and  pre-aeration), primary settling, trickling filtration, secondary clarification, and  seasonal disinfection of up to 250 MGD of flow. Up to another 100 MGD of flow  receives preliminary treatment, primary settling, and disinfection prior to being  blended with secondary-treated flow.    The existing comminutors date to the original 1970 primary treatment facilities.  Although the comminutors have been rebuilt since, the equipment and technology  are obsolete, repair costs are high, and performance is less than optimal. Macerated  and untreated large debris pass from the comminutors where they end up in the  plant sludge and skimmings or to some extent lodged in the trickling filter arms and  media.    The purpose of the Bissell Point WWTF Fine Screen, Concrete, and Gate Improve- ments project is to replace the comminutors with fine screens to remove the solid  and floatable materials from the wastewater flow, thereby reducing maintenance on  downstream liquids and solids pumping and treatment equipment, and enhancing  overall system performance. Along with the comminutor replacement, the project  will also replace the existing sluice gates in the Gate Building and Pre-Aeration  Tanks and provide gates for the new screens. The existing sluice gates are original  equipment dating to 1970. Some of these gates were repaired in the mid-1990s  under the Bissell Point Secondary Treatment Project (Contract BP-14), although  those repairs were largely limited to gate stems and thrust nuts. Necessary concrete  repairs at the gates are also included in the current project scope.   Screening System Performance and Design   The new fine screening facilities must provide a high level of solids removal to  enhance the performance of all downstream liquids and solids treatment processes,  and reduce maintenance on equipment associated with these processes. A high  degree of screening is particularly needed to protect the new equipment being  installed in the upcoming incinerator replacement project. When screening  sewage from combined sewer and older collection systems with a large amount of  inflow, it’s very important to select screening system technologies that provide the  best balance of sometimes conflicting goals of a high degree of screenings capture  and the ability of the screen system to safely remove and process large debris  without damaging the equipment. It is also critical to incorporate design features  that allow the system to remove and process large shock loads of debris in order to  prevent screen blinding and overloading of the screenings transport and processing  equipment during these times of high loading.

Fine screens will reduce high  maintenance costs and poor  performance associated with  the comminutors.     Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District Bissell Point WWTF Fine Screens (12548)     2009-STL-P0044 3        Screening Facility Hydraulics   The most important design consideration for a screening facility is to accurately  model the hydraulic conditions upstream, through the screens, and downstream of  the screens. Downstream water levels determine screen capacity. Occassionally it is  required to provide downstream water level control to allow the screen to process  high flows without exceeding maximum acceptable velocities through the screens,  while allowing the channel water levels to drop under normal/low flows to avoid  excessive grit settling in front of the screens.    Another important consideration for a screening facility is automating the sluice  gates upstream and downstream of the screens to allow taking screen channels on  and off line quickly in response to the wide range of design flows for this project.  Finally, the new screen facility must not result in hydraulic conditions that  detrimentally impact upstream and downstream unit processes.   Sluice Gate Design   Sluice gates in headworks facilities are subjected to high concentration of hydrogen  sulfide, resulting in condensation of sulfuric acid on the gates. We will review the  comprehensive analysis of gate materials already performed by MSD and  recommend the replacement gate design that provides the best balance between  capital cost and long service life.   Constructability   The proposed screen, gate, and concrete improvements should be constructable  such that all dry weather flows will continue to receive full treatment, and that wet  weather flows can be maximized, while continuing to meet Missouri State Operating  Permit requirements.   Odor/Corrosion Control System Design   The proper design of the foul air capture and treatment system is critical to the  success of a new headworks facility, not only to provide a safe environment for the  operators and prevent off-site odor, but just as importantly to prevent corrosion of  the new screening and gate equipment. We have found that typically the most cost- effective odor control system is to provide tight-fitting screen channel covers and  ventilating directly from the channels, thereby minimizing the quantity of foul air  requiring treatment while providing sufficient concentrations of ‘food’ for biological  odor control systems. Installing a fresh air intake on the screens and at the gates  also provides additional insurance against screen and gate corrosion.   Technical Approach  Gate Replacement and Concrete Repairs   The sluice or slide gates that allow isolation of the two influent headers, the six grit  tanks, and four pre-aeration tanks are to be replaced under this project. New gates to  isolate the fine screens will also be provided. The purpose of replacement is to  provide continued reliable service to plant operations.    Three issues need to be addressed as part of the Basis of Design Report:    We performed the condition  assessment and design of  previous sluice gate and  concrete repairs at the Gate  Building and Pre-aeration Tanks  as part of the Bissell Point  Secondary Treatment project.   Jon was PM for odor control  studies at various MSD sites  including Bissell Point that  involved evaluating scenarios  to control odors and phased- approach control plans. He also  led the secondary treatment  expansion that included  addressing trickling filter odor  and ventilation air.     Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District Bissell Point WWTF Fine Screens (12548)     2009-STL-P0044 4         Materials of Construction   Concrete Repairs   Constructability and Construction Sequencing   Materials of Construction  The gates can be constructed of either cast iron (grey, ductile, or Ni-Resist) or  fabricated stainless steel. A Technical Memorandum was previously prepared by  others for MSD addressing materials of construction for the gates. We will review the  findings of that technical memorandum, focusing on material needs for the design  seating and unseating heads, gate longevity, and corrosion resistance. Updated costs  for the gates will be obtained and analyzed to establish valid and competitive pricing  to use in comparison between different materials. We make our design  recommendations based on the results of the analyses. Potential repairs to existing  gate thimbles (erosion, corrosion) will also be addressed in the design.   Concrete Repairs  As part of the Basis of Design Report, our team will conduct a condition assessment  of concrete conditions at each of the actuator pedestals. This assessment will serve  as the basis for determining the extent or estimated quantities of the necessary  repairs. Repair methods will be defined and applied to the estimated quantities to  determine the preliminary cost of necessary repairs. Potential concrete repairs at  gate thimbles will also be addressed in the design.   Constructability and Construction Sequencing  Maximizing flow through the treatment plant while at the same time replacing the  gates is important. Plant shutdowns should be avoided and periods of reduced flow  minimized. An initial review of the preliminary study drawings indicates that each of  the grit tanks and pre-aeration tanks can be isolated, one unit at a time, using stop  planks. The associated grit tank influent gate or pre-aeration tank influent and  effluent gates can be replaced while the tank is isolated. New stop log planks and  lifters may need to be provided by the Contractor if those furnished with the original  construction – 50 years ago – no longer exist. Hydraulic and process loads with one  unit out of service appear to be acceptable; we will verify during the initial design.   Replacing the influent gates on each of the two pump station headers will be  more difficult. A single gate replacement could take several days, to as long as a   week or more, depending primarily on the condition of the  wall thimble and studs and any necessary repairs. An entire  influent header will need to be shut down to replace its  associated gate. The north header has three influent pumps  tied to it and the south header has two pumps. Normally,  two pumps should suffice to handle dry-weather flows.  When the south header is down for gate replacement, the  firm capacity of the north header (i.e., two pumps operating)  appears to be sufficient to handle the range of normal dry  weather flow. Inflows from high river stage or wet weather  may not be able to be pumped, and these conditions should  be avoided for gate replacement. More problematic is  replacing the gate on the north header. The firm capacity of   As principal author of the  District’s Long-Term CSO  Control Plan, we understand  completely the need to continue  to maximize wet-weather flow  treatment during construction  of this project.   Jacobs’ experience is that the  low-head gates proposed for  this project will generally be  less expensive when fabricated  from stainless steel rather than  cast with iron. The prelim’s  average costs for stainless  steel gate pricing was heavily  skewed by a single vendor’s  quote.     Installing stop planks (red) allows all four Pre-Aeration Tank  No. 2 gates (green) to be replaced. All flow is treated in Pre- Aeration Tanks 1, 3, and 4, or is bypassed to primary settling.     Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District Bissell Point WWTF Fine Screens (12548)     2009-STL-P0044 5        the remaining header (i.e., one pump operating) is likely insufficient to handle the  range of daily dry weather flows. Two pumps, as noted above, should suffice.    During the Basis of Design phase of the project, we will further develop concepts for  allowing the influent gates to be replaced. Potential solutions may involve:   Partially pumping down the pump station wet well and tunnel (as is now done   before wet weather events), thereby providing some additional buffer.   Limiting construction to certain seasons when high river or wet weather flows   are less frequent.   Limiting construction durations or establishing fall-back positions in case of   pump failures.   Obtaining permission for reduced capacity from MDNR.   Combinations of the above, or others.    During design, we will investigate other concerns with the influent gate replacement  including the need to remove part of the building roof in order to access the gates  for removal.   Fine Screening   Our technical approach to the fine screening aspect of the project is founded on four  major issues/obstacles that will affect schedule, cost, and ultimately, project  success:    1. Evaluation of Anticipated Screenings Loadings and Characteristics.  2. Screening System Constructability, Maintenance of Plant Operations (MOPO),   and Screen Building Location.  3. Screening System Design.  4. Screening System Operational and Maintenance (O&M) Considerations.   1. Evaluation of Anticipated Screenings Loadings and  Characteristics   The Bissell Point Wastewater Treatment Facility is one of the largest facilities  remaining in the U.S. that is not protected by raw sewage screens. Comminutors fell  out of favor as an acceptable method of processing raw sewage many decades ago  and we fully understand and appreciate how excited your O&M staff is to implement  this project.    One of the biggest challenges associated with the project will be the lack of any  historical screenings loading data. This is not an insurmountable issue.   Because almost all screening projects involve screening upgrades that significantly  increase screening capture, historical data is almost never used to size the screens  and most importantly screenings processing equipment. Our approach to determine  the design screenings loading criteria for this project starts with interviewing your  operations staff about their experience with the existing comminutor system. While  the system doesn’t remove screenings, the operation and maintenance of the  comminutors has been affected by screenings loadings and such factors as types of  large debris that has avoided capture by the grit removal system and shock loading  events that might have overloaded the comminutor system will provide valuable  information.         Pre-aeration tank gates are  corroded and mainly inoperable.     Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District Bissell Point WWTF Fine Screens (12548)     2009-STL-P0044 6        Screenings data from the Lemay Wastewater Treatment Plant will be evaluated and  used while considering any significant differences between the collection systems  serving both plants. Our experience in obtaining screenings data over the years  from similar plants will help us to recommend sufficiently conservative values for  average and peak screenings loading criteria for the project. In some cases, when  peak screenings loadings are unknown, the processing equipment is sized for  maximum screen carrying capacities.   2. Screening System Constructability, Maintenance of Plant  Operations (MOPO), and Screen Building Location   The constructability of the screening system is the most critical factor affecting two  other issues that are crucial to project success: MOPO and Screen Building Location.  Our preliminary analyses indicate that it is possible to construct an effective  screening facility in the existing comminutor channels, but this will require several  considerations:   - Significant additional investigations into the design of required structural  modifications for the various screen designs that are determined to physically  fit within the small footprint of the comminutor channels.   - Structural evaluations to determine feasibility of the modifications.  - Locating the screening transport and processing equipment without   compromising access for O&M of the equipment.  - Locating and providing even loading of the screening receiving bins and   implementing required code upgrades to the existing building.    Our preliminary conceptual layout of the facility is shown on the next page. This  concept design uses the latest in robust screening technology, the center-flow bar  screen (discussed in more detail below), which appears to be the best fit for the  small footprint constraints of the retrofit option. Five duty screens sized for a peak  flow of 70 MGD and one standby screen provide the required peak flow capacity of  350 MGD.    Our preliminary downstream hydraulics analysis indicates that the existing 54” x 54”  comminutor effluent sluice gates would be abandoned, with the channel filled in to  optimize hydraulics through the screen and new 72” x 72” automated sluice gates  installed downstream of the screens. Temporary bulkheads would be placed outside  the existing comminutor influent and effluent channels to allow for modification of  each screen channel individually to accommodate anticipated peak flows through  the facility during construction. For screenings bin access, a new canopy or building  extension would be constructed to allow support of tipping troughs required for even  screenings loading in the bins.   If our detailed analyses of the required structural modifications, constructability, and  O&M considerations for the retrofit option reveal unacceptable factors, we will  provide a new screening building design. The MSD prelim’s basis of design does  appear to be appropriate for the project and there will be far less issues associated  with constructability and MOPO.    Design and construction of the large-diameter yard piping for incorporation of a new  screen building into the existing hydraulic profile is probably the greatest challenge    We have designed numerous  headworks projects including  fine screens (see Section 5).  Many of these were enhance- ments to existing facilities that  needed to remain operational  during construction.        We created a 3D model  (above) for the Trinity River  Authority’s Headworks Fine  Screen Improvement, which  Jacobs was recently awarded.     Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District Bissell Point WWTF Fine Screens (12548)      2009-STL-P0044 7     Preliminary Conceptual Layout of Retrofit for Fine Screening                                                                 Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District Bissell Point WWTF Fine Screens (12548)     2009-STL-P0044 8        associated with the new screen building option. Another important consideration is  construction of the piping, screen channels, building slab, and pile foundations  without compromising the structural stability of the adjacent structures. As seen in  our preliminary layout of a new screening facility on the next page, there is easily  adequate space between the existing Comminutor Building and DEC/Lab to  accommodate a new screening facility, though eliminating the access road between  the buildings would be required. With the close proximity of the new screen facility  to the lab and associated sensitive equipment, a robust odor control system would  be particularly important if this location is selected for the new screen building.   3. Screening System Design  We are in full agreement with MSD’s preliminary analysis that, while perforated  screens can provide significantly greater screenings capture than bar screens, these  screens are not appropriate for being able to withstand the large debris and shock  loadings associated with the combined collection system tributary to the Bissell  Point WWTF. Bar spacing of the proposed multi-rake screens will be an important  consideration in the design of the screens. Typically, bar spacings of either ⅜” or  ¼” are proposed for similar projects. Technically, bar screens with ⅜” bar spacing are  classified as coarse screens, whereas bar screens with ¼” bar screens are classified as  fine screens. An excellent example and lesson learned was realized at a similar large  screening facility, the 440-MGD peak flow West Point WWTP (see sidebar).    We introduced the latest in screening technology – the center-flow bar screen – in  our Comminutor Building retrofit concept above. The greatest challenge associated  with designing screens for optimum capture is the velocity through the bar openings,  referred to as ‘slot velocity’. With the wide range of flow encountered by all screen  facilities and particularly the Bissell Point WWTF, it is always necessary to push  against the upper limits of slot velocities, particularly when incorporating a standard  30 percent blinding factor in the hydraulics analysis of the screens. By orienting the  bars parallel to the channel, the center-flow bar screen essentially doubles the  submerged screen field area, dramatically reducing slot velocities and increasing  screening capture. This technology combines two well-proven technologies: the  center-flow design, that previously was only used on perforated screens, with the  multi-rake bar mechanisms. It is offered by one of the most respected  manufacturers in the field (Huber), who recently constructed a manufacturing facility  in the United States. Because this technology meets both of your project’s two  important goals – maximizing screening capture with a screen capable of handing a  wide range of large debris – we encourage MSD to consider employing this  technology, particularly if the retrofit option appears feasible.   For collection and transportation of the screenings, the profession is quickly stand- ardizing on the completely non-mechanical method using sluice troughs. Sluices  offer many advantages, including simplicity of design and operation, and should be  considered an extension of the washer-compactors that are also becoming standard  as the profession implements fine screen technologies that result in increased  capture of organic material along with the screenings. The water required to sluice  the screenings gets the washing process started immediately; the key to successful  operation of the sluice is to minimize the water used for moving the screenings to  avoid hydraulically overloading the washer-compactors. If a large amount of debris   We routinely work with the  screening vendor technologists,  keeping abreast of advance- ments and improvements in  screening equipment such as  the new center-flow bar screen  technology – the marriage of  two well-proven technologies  that appears an ideal option for  the comminutor channel retrofit.   At the West Point WWTP in  Seattle, a ‘hybrid’ multi-rake  bar screen facility was  constructed, with ¼” screens  treating normal dry weather  flows and ⅜” screens treating  wet weather flows. The ¼”  screens have performed so well  that a project is now underway  to replace the ⅜” screens with  ¼” screens to treat the wet  weather flows.     Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District Bissell Point WWTF Fine Screens (12548)     2009-STL-P0044 9        is captured by the screens, the sluice water simply builds up behind the screenings  until enough head is provided to move the screens down the sluice trough.   Concepts for the New Screening Facility                                                     Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District Bissell Point WWTF Fine Screens (12548)     2009-STL-P0044 10        The number of screenings washer-compactors provided is among the most  important design decisions associated with a large plant screen project, particularly  one serving a combined/high I&I collection system and one where the magnitude of  peak screenings loadings is relatively unknown. The washer-compactor is typically  the “weak link in the chain” of a screening system and therefore we highly  recommend multiple washer-compactors and at least one spare washer-compactor.  Our preliminary layouts presented in this proposal are for two washer-compactors  capable of processing peak screening loadings, with one spare.   Washer-compactor design can be provided either with or without washing tubs  designed to nearly remove organic material completely from the screens. We will  work with MSD and authorities at the preferred disposal site to determine required  screenings quality and make the appropriate recommendations. We have found  modern wash tub design to be robust and low-maintenance and will always  recommend use of the tubs when good screenings quality and odor minimization  is required. The length of the discharge tube on the washer-compactors is also an  important design consideration. Maintaining a tube length of less than 10 feet is  recommended to avoid excessive screenings drying in the tube.   Even loading of the screenings bins is the final challenge of good screen system  design. In the retrofit option, orienting the bin to receive the screenings from the  three proposed washer-compactors doesn’t appear feasible while allowing truck  access to the bin. Therefore we show ‘tipping troughs’ that are open-topped troughs  receiving screenings from each washer-compactor, with sensors that signal when to  rotate the trough and provide an even loading of the screenings into the bin. In the  new screen building option, it will be possible to use a simpler motorized rail system  that moves the dumpster as it loads, referred to as a ‘dumpster-veyor’.   4. Screening System O&M Considerations  The Bissell Point WWTF does have an important advantage when considering the  O&M of the new screening system, with grit removal provided ahead of the screens.  Grit and heavy objects removed in the Detritor grit system will provide very valuable  protection against damage of the screen and washer-compactor components and  minimize the chances of getting large objects stuck in the screening sluice or  whatever screenings transportation device is selected.    Floating debris and lighter grit that escape capture by the Detritors will present the  greatest challenges to the new screening system. Multi-rake bar screens have  become the industry standard as a result of advancements in lower sprocket  design that have essentially eliminated the possibility of failure of this key  component. With cleaning frequency based on water level differential, the multi- rake screens maximize capture while being able to quickly respond to shock loads of  screenings.    As noted, we’ve found sluices to be a highly effective method of transporting  screening requiring little O&M attention. We strongly advise a very conservatively  designed washer-compactor system with fully redundant units because these are the  components of a screening system that are most likely to fail, and when there’s  inadequate washer-compactor capacity, the entire system fails.

Project Principal  Mike McCarty provides corporate support and the commitment of resources.    Design Basis Report  The Design Basis Report will result in several critical and inter-related project  decisions such as the type and design criteria for the new screens and whether the  existing building/channels can be reused. To support this decision making, the  design basis phase has many different tasks, including:   Assess the condition of the existing facilities Establish screenings loadings   Evaluate screen type and manufacturer Select screening system design criteria   Lay out equipment to provide for access/O&M Evaluate the feasibility of modifying the existing  comminutor building and channels   Assess hydraulics for optimal screen performance and  up/downstream impact   Analyze sluice gate materials and costs and needed  concrete repairs   Evaluate the cost of new versus modified facilities and  gate replacements   Assess constructability of planned improvements and  impact on operations   As each pre-design task is initiated, we assign a Lead Engineer to manage the effort  and coordinate work assigned within our team. The Lead Engineer draws support  from our team's technical leadership positions – process, structural, mechanical,  construction, etc., as well as our specialized engineering discipline pool. Support  services may include surveying, geotechnical, and professional cost estimators.   Final Design  We provide services and resources to manage final design efforts, including analyses  and calculations, drawings, technical specifications, front end documents based on  2013 EJCDC standards, and opinions of probable construction cost. We take  responsibility for planning, directing, organizing, monitoring, and controlling all  aspects of each work phase. Our demonstrated design experience on large-scale  projects provides proven expertise and best practices that we can successfully apply  to your project. We diligently track personnel assignment workloads and insert staff  with specialized expertise to meet our goals for schedule, budget control, and  quality assurance. By doing so, we produce a project that meets your performance  expectations.   We have local management's  support and the technical  resources to successfully  execute your project. If the  expertise on a particular  topic is located outside the  St. Louis office, we engage  that expertise on short  notice, either virtually (e.g.,  MS Teams) or through in- person meetings as needed.  Recent evidence of our  successful delivery of multi- ple concurrent pre-design  reports and final design  packages was under the  LMRDP program. Jacobs and  our subconsultants delivered  on time and on budget.   Bid Phase   We assign a single individual  to receive and respond to  bidders' questions, thereby  making certain that we give  consistent responses.   Construction Phase  Our team supports the  project during construction,  including attending monthly  project meetings, reviewing  submittals, preparing O&M  manuals, and assisting with  training and start-up.

This will be  critical in properly renewing the plant assets addressed in the proposed project in a  cost-effective and non-disruptive manner.    The Bissell Point WWTF originally went on line in December 1970 as a primary  treatment facility providing grit removal, comminution, preaeration, primary  settling, sludge dewatering by vacuum filters, sludge incineration, and ash  dewatering in two 1871-vintage settling basins. Our Secondary Treatment Project  began in 1984 and was completed in the mid-1990s, meeting the terms of a  Consent Decree (CD) to add secondary treatment to the treatment plant and an  Overflow Regulation System at the CSO Outfalls. Our upgrade helped improve plant  operating efficiency through innovative technologies, met CD construction  deadlines, and employed a phased construction and startup program to correlate  with the District’s funding over a 7-year construction period. An example of our  innovation was providing an additional 100-mgd wet weather flow capacity added at  minimal cost (approx. $10 million) through modifications to an existing junction  structure, upgrades to existing grit removal facilities, and modifications to the  process control strategy. We designed sludge handling systems that included 12  three-meter gravity belt thickeners handling secondary sludge and 15 two-meter  belt presses that dewater the combined sludge as well as upgrades to conveying  equipment and incinerator improvements.   Continuing renewal or replacement of assets at the plant is required to maintain the  ability of the District to meet its goals for providing wastewater treatment. The  Bissell Point WWTF Fine Screens Concrete and Gate Improvements project replaces  the existing comminutors with fine screens and rehabilitates associated concrete  channels and control gates. This project will improve the reliability of headworks  solids removal needed for future sludge incineration improvements and also benefit  O&M of downstream wastewater treatment processes.   Project Manager Jon Bergenthal’s team is finishing up the Trickling Filter Media  Replacement at Bissell Point, and several of our team members bring additional  experience at the facility including the Redundant Sludge Acceptance System, Main  Substation Switchgear and MCC Replacement, and the Sludge Incinerator  Modification projects. Combining Jacobs’ extensive experience with headworks  improvements nationwide (see next page), our legacy knowledge of your overall  collection system, Consent Decree requirements, and the operating capabilities of  Bissell Point, we are able to evaluate industry-best practices and alternatives and  deliver design elements that are efficient and constructible while maintaining the  treatment capacity of the facility throughout construction.    Headworks projects are all unique – there may be no other area of a wastewater  treatment plant that is more misunderstood. Our experience at facilities across the  country has enabled us to solve myriad challenges such as a variety of control  strategies and sequencing for headworks and screening facilities, the balance of   Jacobs at Bissell Point      As a member of a JV, Jacobs  provided planning, design,  construction management, and  startup services for an  advanced secondary treatment  system. We managed six major  subconsultants and directed  fifteen construction packages  We provided management of  construction contracts and  contractors, change orders,  field inspection services, and  preparation of record  drawings. The plant, which  remained in operation during  construction of all improve- ments, was designed,  constructed, and started up on- time and within budget. Bissell  Point’s new facilities performed  to specifications as soon as  they were brought on line.

With several  projects under construction, when finished it will increase peak capacity to 224 mgd.  As part of this project, one of the tasks is to increase the headworks peak 2-hour flow  capacity to 224 mgd. To accomplish this, a new headworks facility with three step  screens was constructed parallel to the existing headworks facility.  Project Approach  The existing headworks facility had four telescoping rake screens that were plagued  with mechanical failures such as overheating of the hydraulic system, cable  breakages, and bearing issues which resulted in binding of the screens. This new  project added three new step screens at the existing headworks facility with the forth  channel converted to a by-pass with a manually cleaned bar screen. The six new step  screens (three in the existing headworks and three in the new headworks) are Huber  SSL 5900 (6mm) step screens with Huber conveyors and washer/compactors.         Rowlett Creek Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant Jacobs  Peak Flow Management Improvements  Rowlett, Texas   HIGHLIGHTS: Installation of Fine Screens, Installation of Sluice and New  Washer/Compactor Equipment, Installation of Screens into an Existing Structure,  Addresses Ragging Issues   The plant has an existing peak 2-hour flow capacity of 60 mgd with phased  expansions performed to expand the capacity to 120 mgd. As part of this project,  one task is to increase 2-hour peak flow capacity of the headworks to 120 mgd.  Project Approach  The existing headworks is a two-channel facility with no room for expansion. The  Owner recently had two new Huber step screens installed at the existing headworks  which will be relocated to the new headworks facility. The new headworks facility  consists of five channels, with two channels for the existing step screens, a new step  screen for Phase 1, a channel for a future step screen, and an overflow channel with a  manually cleaned bar screen. The existing step screens are Huber 6mm with  conveyors, washer/compactors, the new step screens are Westech 6mm with new  conveyor, washer/compactors.

As part of a design-build project, this project involved an extensive retrofit of the  original (1940s) screenhouse, which was abandoned after construction of a newer  Headworks facility in the 1990s.    Project Approach  We proposed and designed perforated screens in the screenhouse. The new  equipment consists of 1/4-inch perforated screens, sluicing conveyor, and washer/  compactor. The screening system provided a higher removal rate. The enclosed  sluicing conveyor captured odor and screening material and the screening  washer/compactor minimized water content, resulting in reduced screening hauling  and disposal costs.   The CBWTP had climber bar screens in their newer headworks at 5/8-inch spacing,  which allow significant debris and solids to pass through, particularly long stringy  debris, pencils, wood sticks, and needles, etc. This caused significant problems for  downstream processes. Furthermore, the climber bar screens often have problems  with upstream rock build up and debris wedged between bars. The screening system  at the headworks has washers and belt conveyors, which do not adequately clean or  contain screenings. These problems have resulted in expensive repairs, extensive  cleanups, and interruptions to the unit process.    With this experience in mind, the City opted for perforated screens in the Screen- house. The new equipment consists of 1/4-inch perforated screens, sluicing  conveyor, and washer/compactor. The screening system provides for a higher  removal rate; the enclosed sluicing conveyor captures odor and screening material;  and the screening washer/compactor minimizes water content, resulting in reduced  screening hauling and disposal costs.    The Screenhouse Project included development of an operational strategy to  operate the screenhouse and headworks in tandem to manage both dry flows and  peak wet weather flows from the City’s CSO tunnels. The existing headworks allows  significant amounts of debris to pass through to downstream process. The new  screenhouse, with finer 1/4-inch perforated screens, is utilized for re-screening flow  that goes through the headworks.   With re-screening and the ability to treat more than the designed capacity, the result  is more floatables and debris captured, and hence, less contaminants discharged to  the river and fewer issues with equipment downstream, as well as discharge permits.    Design was completed within the contracted price with no change orders.

To accommodate this  increased flow, we designed  the retrofit of the original  Screenhouse Facility to  provide preliminary  treatment for wet weather  flows in excess of the  existing headworks’ capacity.   Perforated screen was used  at many facilities in Europe,  but was relatively new in the  U.S., particularly wider than 7  feet. To ensure experienced  manufacturers and quality  screens, the City visited  facilities with perforated  screens and prequalified  manufacturers. The new  equipment was selected by  working closely with BES  staff, and the resulting  facility has proven to be easy  to operate and maintain.       Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District Bissell Point WWTF Fine Screens (12548)     2009-STL-P0044 32        New Water Reclamation Facility Jacobs  Enid, Oklahoma   HIGHLIGHTS: New Fine Screening Facilities to Replace and Upgrade Aging Facilities   Originally built in 1954, Enid’s water pollution control plant had reached its design  capacity and most of the facilities and equipment were beyond their useful lives. We  designed a new 12-mgd Water Reclamation Facility that would handle anticipated  increases in residential and industrial flows while incorporating the existing sludge  processing facilities (aerobic digesters and belt filter presses) into the new design.   Project Approach  The new facility includes influent pumping, fine screening, primary clarification, and  an activated sludge system with nitrification to meet effluent limits. Secondary  treatment is provided by VertiCel® aeration basins (a modified suspended growth  activated sludge system with vertical loop reactors and fine bubble aeration tanks)  and final clarifiers. The VertiCel BNR process combines mechanical and coarse  bubble aeration in anoxic tanks and fine bubble diffused aeration in aerobic tanks.  Process control technology utilizes control algorithms and PLC-based I&C    Fine screening facilities include two Parkson Aqua Guard continuous rotating belt,  1/4-inch effective screen opening spacing, full-channel-width inclined screens. Each  screen is mounted in a 4.5-ft-wide, 7.5-ft-deep channel, angled 75° from horizontal,  and is capable of passing 22.5 mgd of wastewater. Each fine screen’s channel has a  motor-actuated slide gate at the entrance and a manual-operated operated slide  gate at the exit or downstream end. A manual bar screen, located in a separate  channel, provides screening when the mechanical screens’ capacity is exceeded or  requires maintenance. The screenings lifted out of the wastewater stream are  deposited into a Parkson Hycor Helican shaftless screw-type conveyor. The  screenings conveyor has a capacity of 53-cf per hour of wet screenings. Screenings  from the conveyor are deposited into a Parkson Aqua Washpress Screenings  Compactor where they are mixed with water, washed to remove organic material,  compressed to remove free water, and conveyed and deposited into a dumpster.   San Jose-Santa Clara Regional WW Facility Headworks Design-Build  Jacobs  San Jose, California   HIGHLIGHTS: Installation of Screens, Installation of Sluice and New Washer/  Compactor Equipment, Installation of Screens into New Structures   Project includes construction of a new Headwork No. 3 for this 400 MGD peak flow  plant, including 3 multi-rake screens rated for 105 MGD each, screening sluice, 2  duty/2 standby washer-compactors, raw sewage pumps, and 6 conical tray grit  removal basins.  Project Approach  Jacobs was awarded this design-build on the basis of an “indicative design” for the  new Headworks 3 adjacent to existing Headworks 2 to replace the 30-year-old  Headworks 1. We found that the new headworks on a more open site of the plant  would not only save construction cost but allow for flushing large interceptors.   Client/Owner  City of Enid (Engineering Dept.)

When the City was faced with an unreasonable compliance schedule, we  assisted them in negotiations with MDNR.  We devised a workable schedule for  upgrading the treatment plant, an affordable penalty, and a reasonable  supplemental environmental project that would benefit the community. All  compliance milestones have been met.   Project Approach  We provided regulatory compliance assistance, facility planning, antidegradation  review, user rate study, SRF funding application assistance, design, bid phase, and  construction phase services for a new, larger Wastewater Treatment Facility at a new  location. A new site was necessary due to a geologic emergency – the development  of over 24 sinkholes near the existing plant.   We evaluated two new sites, and a variety of treatment process alternatives to meet  projected population growth and future effluent limits including nutrient control.  The new facilities consist of a 60-inch trunk sewer, influent pumping station,  headworks with mechanical fine screens and grit removal equipment, modified  Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) activated sludge process, and ultraviolet  disinfection. The SBR is designed to provide nitrification, and with the future addition  of mixers and adjustment of controls, can be upgraded to remove nutrients. The SBR  process includes a unique peak flow treatment mode that saved the City more than  $1 million in capital construction costs. The belt dryer for biosolids processing is a  state-of-the-art system that includes two waste activated sludge holding basins,  centrifuge dewatering, cake storage, a belt dryer, biosolids storage silo, and truck  loading bay. The system can produce a Class A Exceptional Quality (EQ) pelletized  reusable biosolids fertilizer product.   The fine screening facilities include two Parkson Aqua Guard, 1/4-inch effective  screen opening, full-channel-width inclined screens, capable of passing 25 mgd flow  each. Each fine screen’s channel has a motor-actuated slide gate at the entrance and  a manual-operated operated slide gate at the exit. A manual 3/4-inch opening bar  screen, located in a separate channel, provides 50-mgd screening capacity when the  mechanical screens’ capacity is exceeded or they require maintenance. The  screenings lifted out of the wastewater stream are deposited into two Parkson Aqua  Washpress Screenings Compactors where they are washed to remove organic  material, compressed to remove free water, and deposited into dumpsters.

Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District Bissell Point WWTF Fine Screens (12548)     2009-STL-P0044 35        Bissell Point WWTF Redundant Sludge Acceptance System Donohue  St. Louis, Missouri   Donohue is leading the redundant sludge acceptance system project at the Bissell  Point WWTF. The redundant sludge cake receiving facility will receive sludge cake  hauled in from other District treatment facilities for incineration. Donohue’s efforts  include identifying and evaluating alternatives for the sludge cake receiving facility,  preliminary and final design, bidding support, and construction-related services.     The existing sludge acceptance system allows a truck to dump cake solids into a  below-grade receiving well with a live hopper bottom with augers that drop the cake  into screw conveyors. The screw conveyors discharge into a piston pump, which  pumps the cake to the belt filter press discharge conveyors prior to going into the  incinerator receiving bins. This project adds a redundant system for the existing  sludge acceptance system. The new system includes a below-grade receiving system,  cake storage, conveyance, and pumping. The facility is located so as not to interrupt  the necessary continual operation of the existing unloading facility.     Project highlights include:  • Cake storage, conveyance, and pumping.  • Storage volume and pumping evaluation.  • Right sizing cake pipe, pressure, pump rate, and pump horsepower.  • New power and control panels.  • New electrical duct banks to existing substation.      Bissell Point WWTF Substation Switchgear and MCC Replacement Donohue  St. Louis, Missouri   Donohue evaluated Allis Chalmers and G.E. 4,160V metal clad switchgear and  determined that replacement and consolidation of multiple switchgear buildings  with arc resistant switchgear was most logical.   This included replacement of one dozen low voltage motor control centers (MCC)  consisting of over 70 vertical sections. The MCC replacements improved reliability  for the preliminary treatment portion of the plant. Care was taken to replace one  MCC at a time to limit equipment downtimes. Feeders and conductors were replaced  in kind to prevent splice points.    The WWTF was mostly constructed prior to the introduction of NFPA 820 and  contains multiple tunnels interconnecting the various process spaces. The  preliminary treatment portion of the plant contains communitors, isolation gates,  and open wastewater channels. Plant staff elected to separate the Comminutor  Building from the tunnel, replace the electrical within the Comminutor Building for  NFPA 820 compliance, and add seal-off fittings to conduits.    Challenges include keeping the stations operational throughout construction and  replacing equipment in kind due to limited available floor space. A phasing plan  limits downtimes and periods of reduced capacity at the influent pump station.

The evaluation determined that replacement with arc  resistant switchgear was most logical for the 350-mgd facility. Workshops were held  with Ameren to design the interfaces within the outdoor substation including the  addition of low resistance grounding system to limit the available fault current.    Switchgear was designed to be housed in a sheltered aisle weatherproof enclosure  with split bus, and to be arc resistant with exhaust plenums out of the enclosure. The  project included replacement of variable frequency drives with air cooled drives  designed with integral PLCs to control the start and stop sequences of the pumps  and associated discharge ball valves as well as an exhaust ductwork system that  allows the VFD exhaust to be vented out of the pump station during summer months  and retained for space heating in the winter months.    Special project challenges included keeping the stations operational throughout  construction and replacing equipment in kind due to limited available floor space. A  step-by-step phasing plan was created to limit downtimes and periods of reduced  capacity at the pump station.      Structural Projects for MSD David Mason + Associates  Various Locations   DMA performed a visual structural condition assessment for each trickling filter in  November 2019. For each major TF component, a summary of rehabilitation needs  based on condition observations was developed.      DMA provided structural engineering and construction administration services for  this project that consisted of upgrading the existing belt filter presses to larger and  more efficient units located within a solids handling building. Design included  supplemental structural members to increase the vertical capacity of the supporting  floor for these larger and heavier process units. Specially designed base isolators  were utilized for the new, heavier belt filter presses to maintain existing seismic  forces being applied to the building support structure.     DMA performed structural engineering for the main diversion structure, the 180-ft- diameter storage tank, influent and recycling pump station, and several junction  chambers. These services included design of the elements and construction  administration services. DMA was responsible for the final design and preparation of  construction plans and specifications for the following main components to provide  a fully functional flow equalization facility at Tank Site A: Diversion Structure,  Influent Pump Station, Storage Tank, Odor Control System, Electrical Supply and  Backup Power, Site Work, and Control System for the Flow Equalization System. This  was a prototype project, the first time that MSD utilized aboveground compensatory,  inline, wet weather storage. This design also had to account for the continuing use of  the main trunk line while construction was occurring.
